### Lesson 1.2: The Microbiome Foundation—Why Birth Decisions Matter Long-Term
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/40-microbiome-and-birth.md`, `/content/tldr/40-microbiome-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Your baby is born sterile. The first bacteria they encounter—from birth, feeding, and early contact—colonize their gut and shape lifelong health. Vaginal birth, skin-to-skin, breastfeeding, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics all contribute to a healthy microbiome. C-sections and antibiotics disrupt this but can be mitigated.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Documentary:** "Microbirth" (2014) - Explores how birth affects the infant microbiome

- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - The Microbiome and Your Baby](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural) - Search for microbiome episodes
- **Book:** "Let Them Eat Dirt" by B. Brett Finlay and Marie-Claire Arrieta

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. How does understanding the microbiome change how you think about interventions during birth?
2. If you need a C-section or antibiotics, what steps can you take to support your baby's microbiome?
3. What surprised you most about the connection between birth and long-term health?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Research your current GBS status or note when your GBS test will be
- [ ] Learn about probiotic options for pregnancy and infancy
- [ ] Add "skin-to-skin for first hour" to your birth preferences

### Lesson 1.4: Understanding the Cascade of Interventions
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/38-cascade-of-interventions.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
One intervention often leads to another. IV restricts movement, which slows labor, which leads to Pitocin, which increases pain, which leads to epidural, which requires monitoring, which shows "concerning" patterns, which leads to C-section. Understanding the cascade helps you make informed choices at each decision point.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**

### Lesson 3.1: Hospital Bag Essentials—What You Actually Need
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/18-hospital-bag-checklist.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Pack light for labor (birth is messy), more for postpartum. Essential items: insurance card/ID, phone charger, pillow from home, going-home outfit for baby. Skip: too many outfit options, elaborate entertainment, most toiletries (hospital provides). Partner needs: snacks, phone charger, change of clothes.

### Lesson 3.2: Pre-Labor Logistics—Planning for the Big Day
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/19-pre-labor-logistics.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Handle logistics before labor starts: pre-register at hospital, know the route and parking, arrange childcare/pet care, have phone numbers ready, understand your insurance coverage, discuss work leave with employer. Having logistics handled reduces stress when labor begins.

### Lesson 3.3: Natural Labor Induction Methods—What Works?
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/17-natural-labor-induction.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Natural induction methods have limited evidence, but some show promise: nipple stimulation (most evidence), sexual intercourse (prostaglandins in semen), walking/movement, dates (6 per day from 36 weeks may reduce need for induction). Castor oil is NOT recommended. Labor starts when baby and body are ready.

**Content Source:** `/content/guide/04-when-to-go-hospital.md`, `/content/tldr/04-when-to-go-hospital-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Arriving too early doubles your C-section risk. Labor at home as long as safely possible. Go when contractions are 3-4 minutes apart, lasting 60+ seconds, for 1+ hour, and you can't talk through them. Warning signs requiring immediate attention: bright red bleeding, baby not moving, green/brown water, severe headache, fever.

# MODULE 4: DURING LABOR
## Week 4: Hospital Admission, Monitoring, IVs & Labor Interventions

### Lesson 4.1: What to Expect at Hospital Admission
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/24-hospital-admission.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Triage assesses whether you're in active labor. Expect cervical check, monitoring, vital signs, paperwork. You may be sent home if not in active labor—this is normal, not failure. Once admitted, set the tone: share your birth preferences, build relationship with your nurse, keep lights dim and environment calm.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - What to Expect at the Hospital](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Hospital Birth Stories](https://thebirthhour.com/)
- **Book:** "The Birth Partner" by Penny Simkin - Hospital chapter

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What concerns do you have about the admission process?
2. How will you and your partner communicate your birth preferences to staff?
3. What will you do if you're sent home from triage?

**Action Items:**

### Lesson 4.2: Fetal Monitoring—Continuous vs. Intermittent
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/05-fetal-monitoring.md`, `/content/tldr/05-fetal-monitoring-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Continuous electronic fetal monitoring increases C-section rates by ~63% without improving outcomes for low-risk pregnancies. Intermittent auscultation (listening periodically with Doppler) is evidence-based for low-risk births and allows movement. Ask: "Is there a medical reason I need continuous monitoring?"

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 174 - Fetal Monitoring](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-174-evidence-on-fetal-monitoring/)
- **YouTube:** [Evidence Based Birth - Intermittent Monitoring](https://www.youtube.com/c/EvidenceBasedBirth)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Advocating for Intermittent Monitoring](https://thebirthhour.com/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What's your hospital's policy on intermittent monitoring?
2. How do you feel about wireless/waterproof monitoring options?
3. What would make you accept continuous monitoring?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Ask your provider about intermittent monitoring during labor

### Lesson 4.3: IV vs. Hep Lock & Eating/Drinking in Labor
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/25-iv-vs-hep-lock.md`, `/content/guide/26-eating-drinking-labor.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Most low-risk women don't need continuous IV fluids—request a hep lock instead for IV access without being tethered to a pole. The "nothing by mouth" rule is outdated; ACOG supports clear liquids for low-risk women. Light eating in early labor provides energy; most women naturally stop wanting food in active labor.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 120 - Eating and Drinking in Labor](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-120-eating-and-drinking-in-labor/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Can You Eat During Labor?](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [Evidence Based Birth - IV Fluids in Labor](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/category/podcast/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What's your hospital's policy on eating and drinking during labor?
2. How do you feel about being connected to an IV pole during labor?
3. What snacks will you have available for early labor?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Discuss hep lock preference with your provider
- [ ] Pack labor snacks: honey sticks, juice, crackers, popsicles
- [ ] Add IV/eating preferences to your birth plan

**Downloadables:**

### Lesson 4.4: GBS Antibiotics—Understanding the Trade-offs
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/06-gbs-antibiotics.md`, `/content/tldr/06-gbs-antibiotics-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
GBS antibiotics reduce early-onset infection by ~83% (from 1-2% to 0.2%), but disrupt baby's gut microbiome. Effects persist through the first year in some studies. Probiotics during pregnancy may reduce GBS colonization by 44-50%. If you get antibiotics, breastfeeding is the most important microbiome intervention.

# MODULE 5: BIRTH TYPES
## Week 5: Unmedicated, Epidural, C-Section, Water Birth & VBAC

### Lesson 5.1: Unmedicated Vaginal Birth—What It Takes
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/13-unmedicated-birth.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Unmedicated birth is a learned skill, not just pain tolerance. Key factors: comprehensive childbirth education, continuous support (doula reduces epidural rate by 57%), freedom to move, water immersion, mental preparation. Only 17% of US women achieve unmedicated birth, but rates are much higher with preparation.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Documentary:** "Orgasmic Birth" (2008) - Positive unmedicated birth experiences

### Lesson 5.2: Medicated (Epidural) Birth—What to Expect
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/14-medicated-epidural-birth.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Epidurals provide reliable pain relief but come with trade-offs: restricted movement, increased C-section risk (~2.5x), continuous monitoring requirement, ~25% fever risk, potential to slow labor. You can still advocate for preferences with an epidural: delayed pushing, position changes, immediate skin-to-skin.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 127 - Evidence on Epidurals](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb127/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - What to Expect with an Epidural](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Positive Epidural Birth Stories](https://thebirthhour.com/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What concerns do you have about epidurals?
2. If you get an epidural, what preferences do you still want to maintain?
3. At what point in labor do you think you'd request an epidural?

**Action Items:**

### Lesson 5.3: C-Section—Planned and Unplanned
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/15-csection-birth.md`, `/content/guide/02-vaginal-vs-csection.md`, `/content/tldr/02-vaginal-vs-csection-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
C-sections are lifesaving when medically necessary but overused (US rate 32% vs. WHO recommended 10-15%). If C-section happens, you can still request: delayed cord clamping, immediate skin-to-skin, clear drape, music, gentle/family-centered approach. Recovery takes 4-6 weeks (vs. 1-2 weeks for vaginal birth).

**Content Source:** `/content/guide/36-water-birth.md`, `/content/tldr/36-water-birth-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Water immersion provides 30-50% pain reduction, shorter labor, lower intervention rates, with no increased safety risks for healthy, low-risk pregnancies. Only ~10% of US hospitals offer true water birth; birth centers and home births provide better access. Baby's dive reflex prevents underwater breathing.

# MODULE 6: PUSHING & DELIVERY
## Week 6: Positions, Pushing Techniques & Perineal Support

### Lesson 6.1: Pushing Positions—Beyond Lying on Your Back
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/21-pushing-positions.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Upright positions (squatting, standing, kneeling, hands-and-knees) use gravity, open the pelvis, and reduce tearing. Lying on your back is the WORST position for pushing but standard in hospitals for provider convenience. With epidural, side-lying and peanut ball help. Request position changes every 20-30 minutes.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **YouTube:** [Spinning Babies - Pushing Positions](https://www.spinningbabies.com/category/videos/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Best Positions for Pushing](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 241 - Pushing Positions](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-241-pushing-positions/)
- **Book:** "The Birth Partner" by Penny Simkin - Pushing positions chapter

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What pushing positions appeal to you? Which feel uncomfortable to consider?
2. How will you communicate position preferences during the intensity of pushing?
3. If you have an epidural, what positions are still possible?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Practice pushing positions during pregnancy (squatting, hands-and-knees)
- [ ] Discuss position options with your provider
- [ ] If planning epidural, research peanut ball use

### Lesson 6.2: Directed vs. Spontaneous Pushing
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/35-directed-vs-spontaneous-pushing.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Spontaneous pushing (following your body's urges) is generally better than directed "purple pushing" (coached breath-holding). Spontaneous pushing results in less fatigue, lower pelvic floor damage, and better fetal oxygenation. With epidural, some direction may help since urges are blocked.

- **Podcast:** [Evidence Based Birth - Spontaneous vs. Directed Pushing](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/category/podcast/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What does "pushing when your body tells you" actually feel like?
2. How will you respond if a provider starts counting and directing?
3. If you have an epidural, how will you know when to push?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Discuss pushing preferences with your provider
- [ ] Practice bearing down vs. holding breath
- [ ] Add "I prefer to push spontaneously, following my body" to birth plan

### Lesson 6.3: Perineal Support & Tearing Prevention
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/22-perineal-support.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
4 degrees of tearing, from 1st (skin only) to 4th (through anal sphincter). Prevention: perineal massage from 34 weeks, warm compresses during crowning, slow controlled crowning (not directed pushing), upright positions, avoiding episiotomy. Episiotomy increases (not decreases) severe tearing risk.

### Lesson 6.4: The Moment of Birth—What to Expect
**Content Source:** General from birth guides

**TL;DR Summary:**
The moment of birth is intense and fast. Baby emerges, is typically placed on your chest immediately, cord is clamped after delay. Baby may cry, or may just look at you quietly. The "ring of fire" sensation lasts seconds. Your body releases massive oxytocin. This is the beginning of the golden hour.

# MODULE 7: THE GOLDEN HOUR
## Week 7: Skin-to-Skin, Cord Clamping, Cord Blood, First Bath & Placenta

### Lesson 7.1: Skin-to-Skin & The Sacred Golden Hour
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/08-skin-to-skin.md`, `/content/tldr/08-skin-to-skin-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Immediate skin-to-skin contact regulates baby's temperature, heart rate, and breathing better than any warmer. It triggers bonding hormones, promotes breastfeeding, and stabilizes blood sugar. Most procedures (vitamin K, weighing, etc.) can wait. Keep baby on your chest for at least one uninterrupted hour.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - The Golden Hour](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **TED Talk:** [Nils Bergman: Skin-to-Skin Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRrlcVqUbXw) - Kangaroo care pioneer
- **Documentary:** "Breast Crawl" - Shows baby's natural instinct to find breast
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB - Skin-to-Skin Benefits](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/category/podcast/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What procedures do you want delayed until after the golden hour?
2. How will you protect this time if staff want to intervene?
3. If you have a C-section, how can you still have skin-to-skin?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add "uninterrupted skin-to-skin for first hour" to birth preferences
- [ ] Discuss golden hour with your birth team
- [ ] Plan for C-section skin-to-skin if applicable

**Downloadables:**
- Golden Hour Preferences Template

### Lesson 7.2: Cord Clamping—Why Delayed Matters
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/11-cord-clamping.md`, `/content/tldr/11-cord-clamping-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Delayed cord clamping (waiting until cord stops pulsing, ~1-3 minutes) gives baby 30% more blood volume and 50% more iron. ACOG, WHO, and AAP all recommend it. There's no good reason to clamp immediately. "Your baby's blood belongs in your baby, not in the placenta."

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 196 - Evidence on Cord Clamping](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-196-evidence-on-delayed-cord-clamping/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Delayed Cord Clamping](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **YouTube:** [Evidence Based Birth - Cord Clamping Video](https://www.youtube.com/c/EvidenceBasedBirth)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What's your provider's standard practice for cord clamping?
2. How does delayed cord clamping affect cord blood banking (if interested)?
3. Who do you want to cut the cord?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Discuss delayed cord clamping with your provider
- [ ] Add "delay cord clamping until cord stops pulsing" to birth preferences
- [ ] Decide who will cut the cord (if applicable)

**Downloadables:**
- Delayed Cord Clamping Evidence Summary
- Scripts for Requesting Delayed Clamping
- Cord Clamping Timing Visual

### Lesson 7.3: Cord Blood Banking—The Real Story
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/23-cord-blood-banking.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Private cord blood banking (saving for your family) is expensive ($2,000-5,000 + annual fees) with only 1 in 2,700 chance of ever using it. Public donation is free and helps others. Delayed cord clamping (free, immediate benefit) means less cord blood available for banking. Most families don't need private banking.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB - Cord Blood Banking Evidence](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/category/podcast/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Cord Blood Banking: Is It Worth It?](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Cord Blood Decisions](https://thebirthhour.com/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. Have you received marketing from cord blood banks? How did it make you feel?
2. Do you have a family history that would increase the value of private banking?
3. Is public donation available in your area?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Research public cord blood donation in your area
- [ ] Decide: Private bank, public donate, or neither
- [ ] If banking, register by 36 weeks

### Lesson 7.4: First Bath Timing & Placenta Options
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/27-first-bath-timing.md`, `/content/guide/28-placenta-options.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Delay baby's first bath for at least 24 hours. Vernix (the white coating) is beneficial protection that moisturizes skin, fights infection, and regulates temperature. For placenta: most let hospital dispose; encapsulation has no proven benefits but many swear by it; burial ceremonies can be meaningful.

# MODULE 8: NEWBORN PROCEDURES
## Week 8: Vitamin K, Hepatitis B, Eye Ointment, Screening & Hearing Test

### Lesson 8.1: Vitamin K—Understanding the Trade-offs
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/09-vitamin-k.md`, `/content/tldr/09-vitamin-k-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Vitamin K injection provides near-complete protection against a rare but serious bleeding disorder (VKDB). Without it, risk is 4-7 per 100,000 (breastfed babies); with it, less than 0.3 per 100,000. When VKDB occurs, ~50% have brain bleeding; ~50% of those die or have permanent damage. Oral alternative exists but is less effective (~80% vs ~97%).

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 171 - Evidence on Vitamin K](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-171-evidence-on-vitamin-k/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Vitamin K for Newborns](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Newborn Procedures Decisions](https://thebirthhour.com/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. How do you weigh rare but serious risks against less-invasive alternatives?
2. Does your hospital offer oral vitamin K as an alternative?
3. How do you feel about injections during baby's first hours?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Research vitamin K options at your birth location
- [ ] Decide: Injection, oral, or decline
- [ ] Discuss timing with provider (can wait 1-2 hours for golden hour)

**Downloadables:**
- Vitamin K Options Comparison
- VKDB Risk Calculator
- Questions for Your Provider About Vitamin K

### Lesson 8.2: Hepatitis B Vaccine—Timing Considerations
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/10-hepatitis-b.md`, `/content/tldr/10-hepatitis-b-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Hep B vaccine at birth catches babies of mothers who test falsely negative. If you're confirmed HepB-negative, the 2025 ACIP guidelines now support individual decision-making about timing. You can delay to the 2-month visit if: mother tested negative, no household contacts are positive, and you'll complete the series.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB - Hepatitis B Vaccine Evidence](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/category/podcast/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Hepatitis B Vaccine for Newborns](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **CDC:** [Hepatitis B Vaccine Information Statement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hep-b.html)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What's your Hepatitis B status?
2. Do you have any concerns about the vaccine at birth vs. at 2 months?
3. What does your pediatrician recommend?

**Action Items:**

### Lesson 8.3: Eye Ointment—When It's Actually Needed
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/07-eye-ointment.md`, `/content/tldr/07-eye-ointment-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Eye ointment prevents gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission to baby's eyes. If you've tested negative for both STIs and are in a monogamous relationship, your baby has zero risk of these infections. The ointment blurs baby's vision during the critical bonding hour. AAP is reconsidering mandatory status.

- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Eye Ointment for Newborns](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Podcast:** [The Birth Hour - Newborn Procedures](https://thebirthhour.com/)

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What's your gonorrhea/chlamydia status from prenatal testing?
2. What's your state's law regarding eye ointment?
3. Can you delay the application until after the golden hour?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Confirm your gonorrhea/chlamydia test results
- [ ] Research your state's requirements
- [ ] Discuss with provider: delay vs. decline options

# MODULE 9: HOSPITAL STAY DECISIONS
## Week 9: Circumcision, Feeding, Pacifiers & Rooming In

### Lesson 9.1: Circumcision—An Informed Decision
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/12-circumcision.md`, `/content/tldr/12-circumcision-tldr.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Circumcision is not medically necessary. No medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision. It's a painful surgical procedure (cortisol spikes 3-4x, altered pain responses documented). The decision is cultural, religious, or personal. If you choose it, ensure adequate pain management (not just acetaminophen).

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**
- **Evidence Based Birth:** [EBB 128 - Evidence on Circumcision](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/ebb-128-evidence-on-circumcision/)
- **YouTube:** [Mama Natural - Circumcision: Pros and Cons](https://www.youtube.com/c/MamaNatural)
- **Documentary:** "American Circumcision" (2017) - Comprehensive exploration
- **Book:** "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Circumcision" by Paul Fleiss

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. What cultural, religious, or personal factors influence your decision?
2. If you choose circumcision, what pain management will be provided?
3. How do you weigh the procedure's pain/trauma against your reasons for considering it?

- [ ] If choosing circumcision, confirm adequate anesthesia will be used
- [ ] Make the decision as a couple before birth

**Downloadables:**
- Circumcision Decision Guide
- Pain Management Requirements
- Questions for Provider About Procedure

### Lesson 9.2: Feeding Preferences—Breast, Formula, or Combo
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/16-feeding-preferences.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Breastfeeding is optimal for baby's microbiome and immunity, but fed is best. Early breastfeeding challenges are normal—get support from lactation consultants. If formula-feeding, choose formulas with HMOs and probiotics. Combo feeding is valid. What matters most is a fed baby and supported parent.

**Video/Resource Suggestions:**

### Lesson 9.3: Pacifier Use & Rooming In
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/31-pacifier-use.md`, `/content/guide/32-rooming-in.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Pacifiers are safe once breastfeeding is established (3-4 weeks) and may reduce SIDS risk by 50-90%. Rooming in (baby in your room 24/7) supports breastfeeding and bonding, but using the nursery for rest doesn't make you a bad parent. A rested parent is a safer parent.

# MODULE 10: GOING HOME
## Week 10: When to Leave, First Days Home & Building Your Birth Plan

### Lesson 10.1: When to Leave the Hospital
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/33-when-to-leave.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
Vaginal births typically stay 24-48 hours; C-sections 2-4 days. You can leave earlier if healthy (24-hour discharge requires quick pediatric follow-up). You can stay longer for breastfeeding support or recovery. Don't rush home—use hospital resources. Don't stay longer than you want if you're ready.

---

### Lesson 10.2: First Days at Home—Survival Mode
**Content Source:** `/content/guide/34-first-days-home.md`

**TL;DR Summary:**
The first days are intense: exhaustion, hormones, healing, and learning a new human. Focus on feeding baby, resting when possible, and accepting all help. Baby blues (weepiness, mood swings) affect 80% of mothers and should improve within 2 weeks. If symptoms persist, that's PPD—tell someone.

### Lesson 10.3: Building Your Birth Plan—Putting It All Together
**Content Source:** All guides combined

**TL;DR Summary:**
Your birth plan is a communication tool, not a contract. Keep it to 1-2 pages with clear priorities. Focus on preferences that matter most to you. Discuss it with your provider BEFORE labor.
