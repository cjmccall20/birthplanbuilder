## Flagged Items

### Chapter 14: Epidural Birth

**Edits made**: Added "Types of Epidurals" section (traditional, low-dose, CSE, PCEA), added "When Declining an Epidural Makes Sense" section, expanded blood pressure/urinary/spinal headache/back pain/breastfeeding sections with research data, added cross-reference to ch-unmedicated-birth. No cost figures to audit.

#### Flag 14-1: "Nothing else comes close"
- **Location**: ONE-PAGE OVERVIEW, Five Things to Know, item 1
- **Flagged text**: "Nothing else comes close for managing contraction pain."
- **Issue**: Dismisses all non-epidural pain management methods as inferior. Per CLAUDE.md, alternatives deserve real coverage.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge effectiveness without dismissing alternatives
- **Proposed change**: "No other method provides the same level of pain elimination, though many people find non-pharmacological approaches - like hydrotherapy, movement, and counterpressure - effective for managing labor."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-2: Back labor "last resort" framing
- **Location**: WHEN AN EPIDURAL MAKES SENSE, "Unmanageable back labor" paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "When nothing else helps, epidural can provide relief."
- **Issue**: Positions epidural as a last resort rather than a valid first choice. Per CLAUDE.md, choosing epidural directly should be equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present epidural as a direct option, not only a fallback
- **Proposed change**: "Epidural can provide effective relief, whether you try other approaches first or go directly to it."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-3: Induction implies epidural is expected
- **Location**: WHEN AN EPIDURAL MAKES SENSE, "Induction or augmentation" paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "Many find these harder to manage without medication."
- **Issue**: Normalizes epidural during induction and frames managing without as unusually difficult. Per CLAUDE.md, declining medication during induction should feel equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Add balancing language
- **Proposed change**: "Many find these harder to manage without medication, though many women successfully use non-pharmacological coping techniques like hydrotherapy, movement, and breathing through augmented labor."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-4: "Gold standard" language
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE: BENEFITS, "Pain Relief That Actually Works" heading
- **Flagged text**: "Epidurals are the gold standard for a reason."
- **Issue**: "Gold standard" implies the benchmark against which all others are measured. Frames non-epidural approaches as lesser.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge effectiveness without hierarchy language
- **Proposed change**: "Epidurals are the most effective pharmacological pain relief option for labor, and the evidence supports that."
- **Your decision**: [ X] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-5: Pain statistics only show high-pain side
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE: BENEFITS, "Pain Relief That Actually Works" section
- **Flagged text**: "For context: 30-35% of women describe unmedicated labor pain as 'intense,' and 15-20% call it 'overwhelmingly unbearable.' Epidurals reliably address this."
- **Issue**: Omits that 10-15% report minimal/mild pain and 35-40% report moderate pain. Skews framing toward "labor pain is terrible, epidurals fix it."
- **Recommendation**: Add the full range of pain experiences
- **Proposed change**: "For context: research indicates 10-15% of laboring people report minimal or mild pain, 35-40% experience moderate pain, 30-35% describe it as 'intense,' and 15-20% call it 'overwhelmingly unbearable.' For those in the higher pain categories, epidurals reliably address this."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

Other items: when discussing epidural fever - should give statistics for mother having a fever without epidural. Change title of section from "What they dont tell you" to "Drawbacks of an Epidural" or something like that. Also, we should mention possible complications for epidurals for moms resulting from mistakes (describe the procedure / where pain meds are going and discuss statistics / possibility of the anesthesiologist messing up and injecting where they're not supposed to and causing harm)
Should definitely reference / link to the intervention cascade chapter at least the first time we reference it here
Explain what hypotension means quickly for the reader
First stage: 43-51 additional minutes with modern techniques Second stage: 15-82 additional minutes These are averages - individual variation is enormous. This sentence is missing a period before "Second"
Epidurals increase the risk of tearing due to not being able to basically feel feedback from your body when pushing (research / discuss this in the chapter)

---

### Chapter 17: Labor Induction

**Edits made**: Added "Declining Induction" section, added "Big Baby" concerns with 60% false-positive ultrasound stat, expanded birth ball/castor oil/acupuncture/EPO/raspberry leaf/nipple stimulation with research data, rewrote "Our Take" and Bottom Line for autonomy-respecting tone, added cross-refs to cascade/pitocin/fetal monitoring/informed refusal chapters, added citations 15-19. No cost figures to audit.

#### Flag 17-1: "Why They Push Induction" heading
- **Location**: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU section, subsection heading
- **Flagged text**: "Why They Push Induction"
- **Issue**: "Push" frames provider recommendations as coercive by default, creating adversarial framing.
- **Recommendation**: Reword heading
- **Proposed change**: "Why Providers often Recommend Induction"
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-2: Scare-quote framing of hospital perspective
- **Location**: WHAT HOSPITALS TELL YOU section, final line
- **Flagged text**: "You'll typically hear that natural methods have 'no evidence' and that medical induction is the safest path once you're past due."
- **Issue**: Scare quotes on "no evidence" frames hospitals as dismissive/misleading. Could undermine trust for readers choosing medical induction.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to be more neutral
- **Proposed change**: "You may hear that natural methods lack strong evidence and that medical induction is the most reliable path once you're past due. The full picture is more nuanced."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-3: "Waiting indefinitely isn't safe"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Waiting indefinitely isn't safe."
- **Issue**: Creates a straw man — no one advocates waiting indefinitely. Implicitly frames families wanting to wait longer as reckless.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge nuance
- **Proposed change**: "The evidence does show that risks increase with time, particularly after 42 weeks."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: should be reworded to emphasize that 42 weeks is in the normal range (36-44 weeks) / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-4: "Accept enhanced monitoring"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section, recommendation 3
- **Flagged text**: "Accept enhanced monitoring."
- **Issue**: Directive language — "accept" frames monitoring as compliance rather than choice. CLAUDE.md says never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reword
- **Proposed change**: "Enhanced monitoring is available and can help you track baby's well-being."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

Other items - dont say that castor oil isn't worth it, just warn about risks of diarrhea and explain its efficacy in inducing labor
We should mention that the average, normal range of time for a pregnancy is 36-44 weeks (this is what we learned in Bradley method course - not sure what the source is here but find it and utilize statistics to find the mean/standard deviation). It's not abnormal to bust your due date (especially as a first time mom). Once you get to 41 weeks you should continue monitoring your baby's activity closely and your doctor may want you to come in every day, but don't feel pressured to be induced unless that is what you want. 
Should explain more in-depth what happens with advanced pregnancy / why it can be dangerous due to changing conditions in womb / other science behind it (eg placenta will start to die off / whatever happens here - I forget). This should be before "why they push induction"


---

For intro section to the book - when talking about partnership - emphasize making your desires known beforehand with the doctor and choosing a provider who is supportive (and mention that there's a chapter on choosing the provider and what questions to ask), talk about how you should ideally not go into birth apprehensive about your team. By talking to them beforehand, choosing a good provider who is supportive, communicating openly about your birth preferences, and giving them a copy of your birth plan you should all go into gamed on the same team with the same goal in mind. I think it's already doing a pretty good job of this. Additionally, say to print out more copies than 2 of the birth plan - print out more than you think you'll need. Have one for every shift of nurses, have one to post on your door, one for your health records, one for you and your advocate, and a few extra just in case. It's not necessary, but it's also not a bad idea to attach a gift card to each one you might give to your nurses. They will play a huge role in your experience in the hospital, and nearly universally appreciate Chick Fil A and Starbucks.

### Chapter 29: Newborn Screening

Good to go

### Chapter 31: Infant Pain Management

**Edits made**: Reframed "better alternative" headings to "non-pharmacological options," replaced ranked First/Second/Third choice hierarchy with equal-weight option presentation, expanded non-breastfeeding family coverage, added "Declining Pain Interventions" section, rewrote circumcision pain section with cross-ref to ch-circumcision, replaced prescriptive "Philosophy" closing with neutral "Questions to Consider." No cost figures; no research report.

#### Flag 31-1: Precautionary principle as default wisdom
- **Location**: One-Page Overview, paragraph 3
- **Flagged text**: "the precautionary principle suggests erring on the side of caution—especially when less-studied interventions can be avoided entirely"
- **Issue**: Frames using pain interventions as risky and avoidance as the default wise choice. Positions declining as the smarter option.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present as one valid lens among several
- **Proposed change**: "the precautionary principle is one framework some families use when weighing these decisions — others prioritize reducing immediate discomfort. Both approaches reflect thoughtful parenting."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-2: "What They Tell You" adversarial framing (acetaminophen)
- **Location**: Acetaminophen section heading
- **Flagged text**: "What They Tell You" / "Tylenol is safe for infants and has been used for decades."
- **Issue**: "What They Tell You" sets up adversarial dynamic — implying providers give incomplete/misleading info. Undermines trust for families who follow provider recommendations.
- **Recommendation**: Change heading to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: Change heading to "The Standard Position"
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-3: "What They Tell You" adversarial framing (sugar water)
- **Location**: Sugar Water section heading
- **Flagged text**: "What They Tell You" / "Sugar water is safe and helps reduce pain during procedures."
- **Issue**: Same adversarial framing as 31-2. Creates us-vs-them dynamic with medical providers.
- **Recommendation**: Change heading to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: Change heading to "The Standard Position"
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-4: Pharmaceutical conspiracy implication
- **Location**: Acetaminophen, "What this actually means"
- **Flagged text**: "there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund research that might reveal problems with a generic, inexpensive medication"
- **Issue**: Implies suppressed research. Could read as dismissing families who trust provider recommendations.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present funding reality without conspiratorial framing
- **Proposed change**: "Comprehensive long-term studies are expensive and complex to design, and funding for research on widely available generic medications is limited."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [x ] Reject

#### Flag 31-5: Burden of proof framing
- **Location**: Acetaminophen, end of "What the Research Shows"
- **Flagged text**: "The precautionary principle suggests that when dealing with developing brains, the burden of proof should be on demonstrating safety, not on parents to prove harm."
- **Issue**: Frames the situation as though safety has not been demonstrated, when major health organizations maintain acetaminophen is safe for appropriate use.
- **Recommendation**: Present precautionary principle as one framework, not the correct one
- **Proposed change**: "Some families apply the precautionary principle here, preferring to minimize exposure until more definitive research is available. Others find the existing safety record and organizational endorsements sufficient. Both positions are reasonable given the current state of the evidence."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-6: "Making procedures easier for providers" implication
- **Location**: Sugar Water, "May mask pain rather than reduce it"
- **Flagged text**: "This raises ethical questions about whether we're helping babies feel less pain or just making procedures easier for providers to perform."
- **Issue**: Implies providers use sugar water for their own convenience rather than baby's benefit. Adversarial framing.
- **Recommendation**: Present finding neutrally without attributing motivation
- **Proposed change**: "This raises questions about the mechanism — whether sucrose reduces the experience of pain or primarily reduces the outward expression of pain."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

We should include a chapter on exercises to do before labor to help. Look into the Bradley method course content for a list of exercises to do on a regular / daily basis to strengthen / train the muscles and your body for labor. Include partner exercises as well. Stuff to promote relaxation and also strengthen the muscles / region down there (such as one where the woman tightens and holds down there - I forget what it's called but im sure its easy to fine). Can also talk about how these exercises might help your body recover after labor.

### Chapter 21: Pushing Positions

**Edits made**: No content edits needed — no cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research report. Content gap check passed (positions presented with equal weight, bottom line respects autonomy). Minor gap: chapter is hospital-centric in framing; birth center/home birth settings only briefly mentioned.

Should mention how doulas are trained on this and often very helpful in suggesting different positions. Bradley Method courses can also train you and your partner on different options, and your partner can be the one suggesting different positions. Often helpful to have another person helping you decide in the moment on shifting / changing positions, but, especially if doing an unmedicated birth, your body will help you decide what position to go to (which will correspond with turning the baby or otherwise moving labor forward)

When discussing squatting - mention that the side of the hospital bed can also be used as a squat bar
For standing - mention the position where you have your arms around your partner (or doula's) neck and are basically having them hold you up. Pro tip - if the partner steps back a bit it can help alleviate some extra pain / be more comfortable. 

Can also mention in here how you can wait until contraction crests / gets most intense to actually push so that you're working with your body (muscles that are involuntarily contracting / firing to push baby) so that your concentrated effort / conscious contribution goes further... This crests typically happens about halfway through a contraction. One method is when you feel a contraction coming on take 2 very deep and slow breaths, and at the end of those that's when you start pushing. Much less exhausting than attempting to push throughout the entire contraction.

#### Flag 21-1: Adversarial provider framing (lithotomy origin)
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE section, "The Problem with Lying Flat"
- **Flagged text**: "The lithotomy position—lying on your back with legs up in stirrups—became standard in hospitals not because it's best for women, but because it's convenient for providers."
- **Issue**: Frames providers as prioritizing convenience over patient wellbeing. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to be neutral about historical development
- **Proposed change**: "The lithotomy position—lying on your back with legs up in stirrups—became standard in hospitals due to various factors including provider convenience, provider visibility, monitoring equipment compatibility, and medical training traditions."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-2: "Let's be honest" adversarial framing
- **Location**: WHY HOSPITALS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK, "Provider Convenience" subsection
- **Flagged text**: "Let's be honest: the lithotomy position is convenient for the person catching the baby. They can see everything clearly, have easy access for interventions, and don't have to adjust their position. This isn't necessarily your provider being lazy or uncaring—it's what they were trained to do..."
- **Issue**: "Let's be honest" suggests hidden truth; defensive acknowledgment that providers aren't "lazy or uncaring" implies that's a reasonable interpretation. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Rewrite to focus on systemic factors without implying provider motives
- **Proposed change**: "The lithotomy position offers certain advantages from a clinical perspective: clear visibility, straightforward access for interventions if needed, and consistency with standard medical training. Understanding these factors can help you have productive conversations with your care team about alternatives."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-3: Dismissive of provider reasoning
- **Location**: WHY HOSPITALS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK, "Liability Culture" subsection
- **Flagged text**: "But 'we've always done it this way' isn't a medical reason."
- **Issue**: Dismisses provider perspective. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Delete or reframe neutrally
- **Proposed change**: "You can ask about the specific medical rationale for position recommendations in your particular situation."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-4: "Genuine" emergency implication
- **Location**: HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR ALTERNATIVES, closing line
- **Flagged text**: "Remember: You have the right to choose your position unless there's a genuine medical emergency."
- **Issue**: Word "genuine" subtly implies providers might claim false emergencies. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: "Remember: You have the right to choose your position, and your care team can help you understand if there are medical factors to consider in your specific situation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ x] Reject

#### Flag 21-5: Implied lack of provider support
- **Location**: IF YOU GET PUSHBACK, closing line
- **Flagged text**: "Remember: This is your body and your birth. You have the right to make decisions about your position—and to be supported in those decisions."
- **Issue**: "And to be supported" carries undertone that providers might not be supportive. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Minor reword to maintain empowerment without adversarial undertone
- **Proposed change**: "Remember: This is your body and your birth. You have the right to make informed decisions about your position."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 22: Perineal Support

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) changed directive "Ask your provider or nurse to apply warm compresses" to "You can request warm compresses" (2) changed "consider this a red flag" re: high episiotomy rates to neutral "may not be following current guidelines." No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter well-aligned with CLAUDE.md overall.

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

In discussing the episiotomy, one of the situations it might be necessary - it's possible for a mother to tear up into the clitoris (very painful and serious). In these situations where it appears that this may be inevitable a provider may highly recommend an episiotomy, and you should strongly consider this recommendation for obvious reasons.

---

### Chapter 24: Hospital Admission

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) softened "declining everything isn't the goal" to acknowledge all approaches as valid (2) removed directive "try to stay calm and trust the process" in emergency section. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter already strong on autonomy and informed choice.

For hospital admission be sure to discuss that different hospitals have different policies / procedures here so while this is "standard" you should tour the hospital and understand what is going to happen before game day. Always helps to call while you're on the way to the hospital so they're ready for you. And the fact that this can definitely be a different process if you're going somewhere that you were not planning on (eg if you were traveling and went into labor and were admitted not where you were planning on, or if you were planning a home birth and circumstances or your decision changed)

Nurse will ask to do a cervical check. Should discuss that this will be painful, and there can be risks particularly if your water is broken
This section should also talk about the case of "you don't feel like something is right". Mother's intuition is very powerful. If baby is not moving as much as normal or you have a bad feeling you can insist on staying. Don't stay at home or go back home if you are concerned about your baby's well-being and wonder if something bad is happening - go get it checked out, and get checked in even if its earlier than you wanted to go to the hospital. At the end of the day a healthy mom and healthy baby are the things that are important. 
Mention for iv placement / hep lock that you can refuse, and reference the section we have about it in this ebook
Same with fetal monitoring - mention the section we have discussing this.
The golden rule for partners should really be more along the lines of - make sure your partner (the mom) is as comfortable as possible and shield her from handling anything else. She should be focused on her labor and you should protect her and advocate for her. If the lights are bright and she says it's ok but you know she needs or would prefer darkness - figure out how to get those lights off. If she mentions that she's hungry - get her some food. Make sure she is taken care of, and make sure she isn't distracted by logistics (logistics of advocating for herself or logistics of things like communications with family). She's not necessarily helpless, but every ounce of her focus should be on the marathon she's running (birth), not on things you can take care of. And this is another great place to advocate for a doula. If you have an advocate/partner and a doula there will always be one of you to be present with the laboring mom and an extra set of hands to figure things out plus support her during labor.


This chapter mentions 4-1-1 rule but we're advocating for 3-1-1 rule. Should be consistent and direct to that chapter for more info (on when to go to hospital).

Overall, this book has a lot of repeating information which is good. A lot of this stuff is connected (hospital arrival is connected to when to go to the hospital for example), so it should be giving a lot of the same info and referencing other chapters when decisions come up naturally in different chapters. Such as for this (chapter 24) referencing the hep lock stuff - that naturally should link and reference the chapter about hep locks / ivs, and the information presented should be consistent. We shouldn't be talking about the 4-1-1 rule here when elsewhere it's the 3-1-1 rule. The books should be consistent and self-referencing and reinforcing certain principles and knowledge where relevant because I dont expect everyone to necessarily read the full thing and even if they do seeing info multiple times where applicable helps them to internalize it and connect it all (not saying we need to dramatically lengthen the book or anything by going in depth into the same exact topics multiple times, just make it to where it all synthesizes and makes sense, and give the necessary / applicable info while pointing them towards the more in-depth discussions on that particular topic)


*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

---
We should add a chapter in the pre-labor logistics for meal planning and prepping for after birth. Particularly in the first few weeks it will be difficult to cook / meal prep as normal, so pre-cooking and freezing a lot of different meals/cassaroles and putting them in the freezer should be highly considered. A lot of times grandparents or other members of the community will come and support in these initial weeks, so it's also a great transition to have these in stock for after this extra support leaves. Emphasize good nutrition and meals for recovery + baby benefits and avoiding the default of eating out / ordering a lot of delivery when you don't feel up for cooking and dont know what to do for dinner. Stocking the pantry is also good for minimizing visits to the store. Prepping the natural painkillers such as maxi pads with witch hazel could be in this section, and we can brainstorm other helpful items to have prepared at home so that you are well-prepared for the first few weeks/months after giving birth and can minimize the stress of the daily household grind. Include items that may be applicable for if you have other children in the house in this section too.



### Chapter 25: IV vs Hep Lock

**Edits made**: Fixed 1 cross-reference — changed "see Eating/Drinking section" to proper `@ch-eating-drinking` reference. No cost figures. No matching research.

or IV vs Hep Lock chapter: you don't need a continuous iv if GBS+ and receiving antibiotics. You can be Hooked up, get a round of antibiotics, and then detached from the IV. For this section/chapter we should also discuss the ability to not get an IV or Hep lock as a third option. We should discuss why the hospital will want it (if there is an emergency c section and time is of the essence they'll prefer to already have that established, may be easier to establish it now vice later, etc.) but outline the pros/cons of not getting an IV or hep lock in the beginning. Additionally, discuss concerns about materials in an iv / hep lock (Good question — this is a real concern that's gotten more attention in recent years. Let me search for current info.Short answer: yes, it's a legitimate concern, though the risk from a single labor IV is relatively low compared to prolonged medical device exposure.

**The material issue:**
IV bags and tubing can contain up to 40% DEHP by weight, and roughly 70-75% of IV and irrigation containers in the U.S. are still made with DEHP and PVC. DEHP isn't chemically bonded to the plastic — it can leach out of single-use disposable medical devices like infusion and transfusion systems, resulting in considerable patient exposure.

**Why it matters for labor specifically:**
- DEHP exposure during pregnancy may affect child development, and DEHP can cross from mother to unborn child
- Phthalates cross the placental barrier and have been detected in cord blood and amniotic fluid
- Pregnant and lactating women are identified as susceptible populations by manufacturers themselves
- California classifies DEHP as a reproductive and developmental toxicant

**Practical risk calibration:**
For a standard labor IV (saline drip, hep lock for access), the exposure is on the lower end. The extent of DEHP leaching is largely a function of the lipophilicity of the fluid — plain saline and crystalloid solutions extract less DEHP than lipid-containing fluids or blood products. Median DEHP from IV fluid bags was ~17 μg, and from catheters ~5 μg — well below daily tolerable intake for adults. The bigger exposure risk comes from prolonged NICU use on the newborn, not mom's short-duration labor IV.

**What you can do:**
- Ask the hospital/birth center if they use DEHP-free IV sets. B. Braun and ICU Medical both offer full lines of non-PVC, non-DEHP IV containers and administration sets
- A hep lock with minimal fluid running is lower exposure than a continuous drip
- If Pitocin or other meds are administered via IV, that increases contact time and thus leaching
- You can request this in a birth plan — some hospitals are already transitioning, especially L&D and NICU departments

Bottom line: for a healthy labor with a short-duration hep lock, the DEHP exposure to mom and baby is real but modest. It's not nothing, but it's also not the scariest chemical exposure in a hospital setting. If your wife wants to minimize it, requesting DEHP-free IV supplies is reasonable and increasingly available. The AMA officially encourages hospitals to phase out PVC/DEHP products.) - this content about the iv hep lock stuff doesnt necessarily have to all be in there, it's just an output from me asking another claude instance about concerns about the materials used here, but the concern should be discussed, and the option to decline the iv / hep block should be present and discussed as a legitimate third option here. 

Also, let's label each chapter with a number just so it's easier to navigate the book.

I think you made some edits already here so I removed the flags. Let's integrate the feedback above and it should be good to go. 



---

The table of contents should be structured better. Having numbers will help, but also have some indention (so you see Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, etc.) also if we can make it to where it's a dropdown (so you could minimize the other parts or expand the other parts) then that might be good. If not, the indention of the different chapters under the overall parts + numbers should definitely help a lot here. Let's actually try that before any dropdown stuff is put in there for simplicity's sake (numbers + indentions)

### Chapter 26: Eating and Drinking During Labor

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Chapter presents eating/drinking as the evidence-based preferred choice but doesn't give equal treatment to fasting as a valid option. No acknowledgment that some may prefer to fast for personal, cultural, or comfort reasons.

In the quick answer - let's expand just a little bit more, explaining the 1940s origination to explain that it was because of surgery concerns, and a small risk of asphyxiation should an emergency c section with anesthesia need to be performed. Also mention that eating or drinking during labor is often chosen because labor is a very physical energy intensive process that can take a long time, and women who eat and drink during labor often have more energy and less fatigue.
When discussing how modern anesthesia techniques have made this risk extremely rare, mention that people undergo emergency operations under anesthesia all the time (if someone is in a car wreck on their way home from Golden Corral and requires anesthesia in emergency surgery, it's very rare for any complications related to this, and care would not be prevented because they have a full stomach). 
Change why some families choose to fast to why some women choose to fast, and change not every laboring person to not every woman in labor. These are women, not "persons" - no need to be gender neutral here or anywhere else throughout the book. Add this as a rule / to the claude.md file

Should also mention here that if you desire to eat but the hospital has restrictions that they wont lift, you should bring snacks and your partner can sneak them to you if needed. It would also be good to add some common foods that women might eat here / easy snacks to bring, and considerations for the best foods to eat (lighter, energy replenishing foods as well as drinks that will replenish electrolytes). This can stay in the our take portion but I think it deserves its own paragraph too.

### Chapter 36: Directed vs Spontaneous Pushing

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Evidence section lists problems with directed pushing but doesn't list potential benefits (e.g., helpful for those who want structure, may help coordinate pushing efforts). One-sided evidence presentation.


I think I previously mentioned the thing about the pushing when your contraction crests - let's include that info in this section too (it's based on the Bradley method protocol for pushing).

When referring to women pushing in this section - don't say "families", say "women" eg "Many families choose to push when" should be "Many women choose to push when"

### Chapter 16: Feeding

**Edits made**: 2 cost fixes (HMBANA donor milk `$1-5/oz` → `$4-8/oz`, IBCLC consult `$15-200` → `$100-300`), 1 cross-reference fix (broken link → `@ch-skin-to-skin`), 4 research integrations from `research/10-feeding-preferences-research.md` (AAP 2022 breastfeeding update, IV fluid weight study, JAMA 2025 IBCLC effectiveness review, UCSF limited supplementation study).

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

Ok this is going to be a tough one here... Formula is safe, regulated nutrition should not be a line in here. I know this might sound a little judgy here and may go against the no judging thing but the research is very clear that breast milk is best, and breast fed is best. We need to go into the downsides of formula and make it clear that this should not be the preferred option for infant health. If mom is unable to breastfeed or produce milk we should present trying to find it for your baby from another mom as a better option than formula, but then talk about how if you are going to do formula that you should likely go for the European brand formula. A lot of formula has a lot of vegetable oils, corn syrup, and other harmful compounds that do not stimulate infant development well and are actively harmful. Fed is not best - breast is best. Hospitals that espouse this are correct, but some will push you to give formula or supplement with formula especially based off baby weight. It should be addressed that if you have an iv baby will lose more weight. We need to rewrite this section overall to pump up the breastfeeding, espouse all the benefits of it, and basically write about natural mitigations if you cant breastfeed. Basically, address the pros in terms of flexibility for pumping or formula, but list the costs of not breastfeeding EBF is the best optimal outcome for baby. Followed by mix of pumping and breastfeeding, getting milk from another mom, and then formula (and if formula is necessary helping to choose a formula without all the bad stuff like seed oils and corn syrup). Breastfeeding is also more convenient in a lot of ways (no cleaning bottles, free, etc.) and has other benefits that should be covered like helping baby get a better palette. There's no reason to make anyone feel bad about their decisions or limits, but this book is about how to make decisions to have healthy babies and I think this is one of the most science-backed, incontrovertible topics here - breastfeeding is absolutely better for the health and development of infants in probably every way possible (unless maybe the mother is very unhealthy or some other crazy circumstances here, but if that is the case, then that infant will be receiving subpar nutrition, antibodies, and gut bacteria compared to babies being breastfed). I know we cover a lot of this in there, but the overall tone and take and info presented here in this section should be different. While the goal here is to be non judgmental and equip moms with the info to make decisions, "fed is best" is not the conclusion here that I want. We should be equipping mothers with the support and guidance that they need to understand that breast is best, and the support and guidance to maximize the probability of a good latch and successful breastfeeding + resources to help here, and then other options if that doesnt work out (finding milk from another mom or if they need to go the formula route giving the best formula recommendations). Both logistical and health drawbacks of formula should be covered, but we can concede that if there is no other possible option for their situation then it's obviously preferable to feed the baby and in that case try to find the best, most nutritious formula available.

NEW EDITS BELOW: START HERE FOR NEXT ROUND OF IMPLEMENTATION


On intro - line for "Epidurals help some women cope" - let's expand just a little bit so there's not negative connotation with birth. They help some women cope with pain or relax and stop fighting contractions. For line about studies not being conducted for newborn procedures, can also mention that many researchers are hesitant to perform studies on infants and pregnant women. Take out example (like breastfeeding for pain) in the line about is there a less studied alternative. For Chick Fil A and Starbucks gift cards are nearly universally appreciated - change it to be a little bit more humorous (Every nurse I've ever met loves Chick Fil A and Starbucks). For when something goes wrong during birth - don't mentioned injured babies. Say something like "Juries tend to be more sympathetic to injured patients than big corporations". For paragraph on choose a provider who is supportive - change "interviews" to "interviews and routine check up visits/appointments" in the last sentence of that paragraph. For bring an advocate, include friend as an option with partner, doula, supportive family member (add friend as a final option). For circumcision paragraph, mention at the end that we dive deeper into the pros and cons of the procedure in its own chapter. Also address the idea that often parents may want their son to "look like dad" - and invite them to thoughtfully read the chapter and learn about it because this is such a huge, permanent procedure for a little boy. 

On breastfeeding chapter - take out the statement about how burning the calories can help "support postpartum weight loss" (Leave in line about burning calories). Breastfeeding can actually make moms retain some extra fat / make it harder to lose weight because body is storing it as reserves. I think portions of this section need to be reformatted visibly to show hierarchy properly. Like It has Professional Support: in italics and below it Lactation Consultant (IBCLC): in the same font / italics below it. Additionally, we should outline the differences between a lactation consultant, CLC, and IBCLC in this section, mention that for a lactation consultant there's no real certification and anyone could call themselves that, and talk about things they can help with mechanics, positioning, weighing baby before and after feeding to see how much they are getting, etc.)

### Chapter 23: Cord Blood Banking

**Edits made**: 3 cost fixes for same-number ranges — initial collection `$1,500-$1,500` → `$1,400-$2,500`, annual storage `$100-$100` → `$175-$300`, 18-year total `$1,300-$1,900` → `$4,550-$7,900`, quick reference table `$1,000-$1,000+` → `$4,500-$8,000+`. No cross-references, no research report.

The real costs - numbers dont make sense for ranges.

Our take should be a little bit more in favor of delayed cord clamping, and say that if they are considering cord banking of either kind that they should read through the delayed cord clamping chapter. Should highlight some key points from the delayed cord clamping chapter in the delayed clamping trade-off, and make sure that the recommendations from that chapter are consistent with the our take and delayed clamping trade-off. There needs to be a one page overview for this section that also discusses and highlights this point. 

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

### Chapter 27: First Bath Timing

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Chapter strongly favors delayed bathing without acknowledging families who might choose earlier bathing for cultural, personal, or bonding reasons. Missing perspective on why some families prefer early bathing.

For what it is, mention that many families wait even longer for the first bath (than 24 hrs). I believe some will even wait a full week. 

#### Flag 27-1: Directive language in Quick Answer
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "Delay your baby's first bath for at least 24 hours—ideally longer."
- **Issue**: Directive language telling readers what to do. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informed choice
- **Proposed change**: "Many families choose to delay their baby's first bath for at least 24 hours—some wait even longer."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 27-2: Directive Our Take opening
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 34
- **Flagged text**: "Tell the hospital you want to delay the first bath."
- **Issue**: Command language assumes this is the only valid choice. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Present as one valid approach
- **Proposed change**: "If you choose to delay the first bath, let the hospital know your preference."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 27-3: Dismisses early bathing
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "There's no medical reason to wash it off immediately."
- **Issue**: Dismisses the choice to bathe earlier without acknowledging families who might prefer it (cultural practices, personal preference). Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge both approaches exist
- **Proposed change**: "The choice of when to bathe is yours—recent research shows potential benefits to waiting."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ x] Reject
Take out line of "A gentle, warm bath given with care is not harmful to a healthy newborn". I think our take should lean a little bit more towards delayed bathing for at least 24-48 hours, even longer if the parents are comfortable with it. Vernix has a biological purpose and there are proven benefits to it. This is not a decision that will make or break your baby, but if you choose to wash the vernix off early be sure to pay even closer attention to the temperature of the environment for your newborn. Either way, neither choice is dangerous and your baby will be ok regardless of when the first bath is, though if you are planning on breastfeeding then it's a strong recommendation to not interrupt the golden hour for a first bath.

### Chapter 28: Placenta Options

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) softened dismissive "The evidence for placenta consumption is weak, but it's your choice. Just know the benefits are mostly anecdotal" to "The evidence for placenta consumption is limited—benefits are primarily anecdotal rather than scientifically proven. You can make an informed choice based on what feels right for your family." (2) softened directive "go for it—just don't rely on it" to "you can pursue it while being aware that the evidence doesn't support the claimed benefits."

*No tone flags — clean chapter after direct fixes.*
This doesn't need to be a longer chapter, but I feel like it could be beefed up some. Explain the cultural tradition behind burying it (the tree that grows represents that child), do some more research into the pros/cons of it (see if there are other studies that may support it). I dont know a ton about this topic but I've read about it re-introducing pregnancy hormones (which may not be great for either the mom or nursing baby) and pros as well... Should mention that many doulas offer placenta encapsulation as a service.

### Chapter 30: Hearing Test

**Edits made**: Added "REASONS SOME FAMILIES DECLINE OR DELAY" section covering families preferring minimal intervention, false positive anxiety, pediatrician-based testing preference, and cultural/religious considerations. This was a content gap fix — the chapter previously presented no reasons anyone might decline.

#### Flag 30-1: "Do it" in Quick Answer
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "There's no real downside. Do it."
- **Issue**: Direct command telling readers what to do. Per CLAUDE.md, declining must be equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informed choice
- **Proposed change**: "There's no real downside, making this a screening most families choose to complete."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 30-2: "Just do it" in Our Take
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 46
- **Flagged text**: "Just do it."
- **Issue**: Direct command. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Express perspective while respecting autonomy
- **Proposed change**: "This is one we'd recommend without hesitation."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 30-3: "Easy yeses" framing
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 48
- **Flagged text**: "This is one of the easy yeses."
- **Issue**: Dismisses the possibility that informed parents might have reasons to decline. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge strength of evidence while maintaining autonomy
- **Proposed change**: "The evidence strongly supports this screening, and it's one of the most straightforward decisions in newborn care."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 32: Pacifier Use

**Edits made**: 2 content gap fixes — (1) Quick Answer reframed to present both immediate and delayed pacifier introduction as equally valid choices (2) Our Take restructured with "Your timing options" format giving equal weight to breastfeeding families, formula families, and those choosing no pacifier. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

*No tone flags — clean chapter after content gap fixes.*

What would most IBCLCs say in response to this chapter? 

We're more focused here on the birth to the first 1-2 weeks.  I dont mind projecting 3-4 weeks out here though.
Some pro tips - there are many different types of pacifiers, and different babies like different shapes. If you're planning on using them (or want to have them just in case), purchase multiple different brands. Should also give tips on the best / healthiest pacifiers out there (ones that stay clean / would not get moldy as well as ones that dont have plastic / phthalates and give some brand recommendations).

The brand recommendations thing kind of brings up an interesting idea for this literature as well as others I'll be writing. Why list brand recommendations when I could have a page on my website for each of these bits with different recommendations as well as affiliate links? Could link to it in the book, be able to keep pages like that updated and more current, and make money off of them. Maybe flag this for future aspect of the project here. Any other spots in the book where it might make sense to make recommendations / link to stuff? Im sure in the logistics section there would be plenty. We could even include a section on prepping the nursery and link to affiliate marketing pages for items such as cribs, sheets, bassinets, etc. Definitely a good opportunity here to provide valuable content and make more money off of it.

### Chapter 33: Rooming In

**Edits made**: None needed. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter already well-aligned with CLAUDE.md philosophy — presents rooming-in and nursery use as equally valid choices.
Could add more opportunity for your partner to bond with baby when rooming in. Baby will likely be asleep for most of the time especially in those early days (they went through the same labor you did and especially in those early days are quite exhausted / recovering). Should mention that if you are planning to EBF and want to use nursery make it very clear that they should not feed baby formula without your consent. 
Partner can learn to change diapers better with baby in room.
Other benefit of rooming in - kind of covered in the "hospital errors" but can expand on it - when baby is in your sight with you (and/or your partner) then it's more unlikely that mistakes or unwanted procedures/interventions would happen.
Our take should discuss more about how as a mom (and this is true now and will be true for awhile) your number one priority will be the well-being of your baby, but you need to ensure you are taking care of yourself as well, and your partner's focus should be on taking care of you so you can take care of the baby. Dont feel guilty if you feel like you need to use the nursery, but there are real benefits, particularly if breastfeeding, to being in-room. Being in-room also gives the opportunity for you to bond as a new family / with your new family member in those first few moments. As Mom you are that baby's whole world and the only thing the baby has ever known, so being closer to you, held by you, etc. is very comforting to the baby.

### Chapter 34: Leaving the Hospital

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 34-1: "Don't rush home" directive
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Don't rush home just because you can."
- **Issue**: Directive language telling readers what not to do. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as balanced consideration
- **Proposed change**: "Some families prefer to leave as soon as possible; others find value in using the full stay. Both approaches are valid."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 34-2: "Don't stay longer than you want" directive
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Don't stay longer than you want to, either."
- **Issue**: Same directive pattern in opposite direction. Per CLAUDE.md, present choices without commands.
- **Recommendation**: Fold into the rewritten passage above
- **Proposed change**: (Covered by Flag 34-1 rewrite — both directives replaced with balanced framing)
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

For what must happen before discharge, the screening / heel prick should be presented as options, not requirements before discharge. "Requires followup appt within 1-2 days" -> pediatricians will often push for a followup appt within 1-2 days. Pediatrician in the hospital is often the one who will be able to see them if you don't have one already lined up. For insurance coverage - this should be framed in terms of cost. If you dont have insurance then the cost of staying could be significant, so leaving earlier could be a cost consideration. The consideration of being in your own space, not getting woken up by nurses and other staff / hospital busyness, being more comfortable, etc. is also a good thing to think about for pushing to go home. Plus concern about how you could get sick in the hospital. Some hospitals can "discharge" you from care while allowing you to stay another night if you are interested in that.

---

### Chapter 35: First Days at Home

**Edits made**: None needed. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter well-aligned with CLAUDE.md philosophy — practical guidance without prescriptive language.
This chapter really needs to be beefed up with more recommendations. The signs of concern are good. For mom to take care of herself and recommendations for partners / other support members should be here. Should reference chapters on pre-labor logistics for making sure you're set up for success. Should talk about how to deal with pain, how to get good nutrition, etc. Give recommendation to use the Huckleberry app to track diapers. Give recommendation to schedule appt with CLC / IBCLC for breastfeeding, especially if first time. Could have brief discussion on having baby sleeping in room with you, and even in bed with you so that feeding does not involve getting up and going to a whole other room. Should talk about tips for safe co-sleeping, and how even if you are not planning on doing bed-sharing you should know how to do it safely because most parents will bed-share at some point even if not planning on it due to exhaustion and its convenience, particularly for breastfeeding. Can also talk about how babys will need and want to be held constantly, and explain their biological need for this.
*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

### Chapter 37: Water Birth

**Edits made**: 4 cost fixes for same-number ranges — birth center `$1,000-$1,000` → `$4,000-$8,000`, home midwife `$1,000-$1,000` → `$4,000-$8,000`, hospital tub `$100-$100` → `$200-$500`, reusable pool `$100-$100` → `$200-$400` and liners `$10-$10` → `$20-$40`. No cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 37-1: Our Take promotes water birth as superior
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section, opening
- **Flagged text**: "Water birth is one of the most evidence-based comfort measures available for labor."
- **Issue**: Frames water birth as superior to other comfort measures. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as one of several options
- **Proposed change**: "Water birth is a well-researched comfort option that some families find highly effective during labor."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 37-2: Institutional criticism
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "The fact that many hospitals restrict water birth despite the evidence says more about institutional inertia than about safety."
- **Issue**: Frames hospital policies as irrational. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives — hospitals may have valid operational/liability reasons.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital policies on water birth vary widely. Some restrict it due to liability concerns, staffing considerations, or interpretation of the evidence — while others actively offer it."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [x ] Reject

#### Flag 37-3: Prescriptive "should" statements
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "If water birth appeals to you, you should have access to it."
- **Issue**: "You should" is directive language. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informational
- **Proposed change**: "If water birth appeals to you, it's worth exploring your options — whether at a birth center, at home, or by looking for hospitals that offer it."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ x] Reject

Is the epidural use statistics consistent with other epidural use statistics we have in other portions of the book? 43% of women have epidurals? I assumed it'd be higher than this number. Take out little paragraph on continuous fetal monitoring right before the birth center water birth paragraph 
The birth center costs under advantages over hospital are still off (even though it says the edits have been made)

### Chapter 38: VBAC

**Edits made**: Reverted agent's bad edit — agent changed "the evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option" to "VBAC should be the default recommendation" (more prescriptive, not less). Restored to: "The evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option for most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean." Also softened "optimal choice" to "well-supported choice." Multiple cost fixes applied by agent (2026 ranges verified). No matching research report.

#### Flag 38-1: "Should be the default recommendation"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, opening paragraph (REVERTED — no longer in text)
- **Flagged text**: "VBAC should be the default recommendation for most women" (this was the agent's bad edit, now reverted)
- **Issue**: Prescriptive language. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Status**: FIXED — reverted to "The evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option"
- **Your decision**: No action needed (already fixed)

#### Flag 38-2: "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" is "harmful"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, second paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "'Once a cesarean, always a cesarean' is outdated and harmful."
- **Issue**: "Harmful" is a strong value judgment that may alienate families who chose repeat cesarean. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Soften to factual framing
- **Proposed change**: "'Once a cesarean, always a cesarean' is a 1916 statement that referred to a surgical technique no longer in use. Modern evidence supports a more nuanced approach."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ x] Reject
Turn the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network calculator into a link
For Who Chooses HBAC - should define that it's Home Birth after Cesarean (HBAC) in the line
vbacfacts.com should be a link
For continuous fetal monitoring - another alternative is that many hospitals offer cordless / mobile continuous monitoring (where woman wears the monitor but can move freely)
I feel like we cover the concept of "VBAC bans" multiple times, might be unnecessary. Do a quick audit of this chapter and see if we can clean it up some / if it's too long-winded and repetitive. Don't need to avoid all repetition, but I feel like this section is redundant here.
Do the recovery figures cited in the cost benefit analysis (2-4 weeks vs 6-8 weeks) correspond to other sections of the book? If its not the same then 
With VBAC attempt for what you get - I remember learning int he Bradley course that the process of labor helps women (and baby) hormonally and in other ways, and that there are clear benefits to doing labor even if it does result in a c section because it helps prepare the woman's body for breastfeeding and basically helps her process the birth (whereas with a planned c section it's just like all of a sudden you're not pregnant anymore and boom the baby is here)... See if you can find anything to support this and then put it in intelligently in what you get (and make sure its cited properly)

### Chapter 40: Childbirth Education

**Edits made**: Multiple cost fixes to 2026 ranges — Bradley `$100-500` → `$200-600`, Hypnobabies `$100-400` → `$150-500` (self-study `$165` → `$195`), HypnoBirthing `$100-350` → `$150-450`, Lamaze `$100-300` → `$100-400`, Pink Kit `$10-120` → `$15-150`, Birthing From Within `$150-400` → `$200-500`, doula context `$100-2,500` → `$800-3,500`. No cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 40-1: Hospital class dismissal
- **Location**: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU section
- **Flagged text**: "Hospital childbirth classes are designed to make you a compliant patient, not an informed decision-maker."
- **Issue**: Dismisses hospital education as indoctrination. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe to neutral comparison
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital childbirth classes tend to focus on what to expect at that specific facility and how to work within their protocols. Independent classes often cover a wider range of options and decision-making frameworks."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 40-2: Absolute statement about class outcomes
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "A hospital class alone won't get you there."
- **Issue**: Presents as fact. Some families find hospital classes sufficient. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Soften to perspective
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital classes are a starting point, but many families find that supplementing with independent education deepens their preparation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 40-3: "Don't skip this" directive

#### Flag 40-4: Budget dismissal
- **Location**: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS section
- **Flagged text**: "If budget is a concern, free resources exist — but they're not the same as a structured course."
- **Issue**: Dismisses free resources as inferior. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge free resources as valid
- **Proposed change**: "If budget is a concern, free resources like Evidence Based Birth, YouTube-based courses, and library materials can provide solid education. Structured paid courses may offer more depth and personal support, but free options have helped many families feel well-prepared."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

Other edits:
For the chapter about when to go to the hospital - let's change it to The Stages of Labor (When to go to the Hospital) in parentheses.
In this chapter we should also discuss all the actions that the baby takes in the womb to facilitate labor / be born. Baby is an active participant in the process - discuss what actions they take and how hard they work to help mom with the birthing process (I dont remember specifics here but I remember learning about it in Bradley method course and thought it was awesome)
