## Flagged Items

### Chapter 14: Epidural Birth

**Edits made**: Added "Types of Epidurals" section (traditional, low-dose, CSE, PCEA), added "When Declining an Epidural Makes Sense" section, expanded blood pressure/urinary/spinal headache/back pain/breastfeeding sections with research data, added cross-reference to ch-unmedicated-birth. No cost figures to audit.

#### Flag 14-1: "Nothing else comes close"
- **Location**: ONE-PAGE OVERVIEW, Five Things to Know, item 1
- **Flagged text**: "Nothing else comes close for managing contraction pain."
- **Issue**: Dismisses all non-epidural pain management methods as inferior. Per CLAUDE.md, alternatives deserve real coverage.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge effectiveness without dismissing alternatives
- **Proposed change**: "No other method provides the same level of pain elimination, though many people find non-pharmacological approaches - like hydrotherapy, movement, and counterpressure - effective for managing labor."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-2: Back labor "last resort" framing
- **Location**: WHEN AN EPIDURAL MAKES SENSE, "Unmanageable back labor" paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "When nothing else helps, epidural can provide relief."
- **Issue**: Positions epidural as a last resort rather than a valid first choice. Per CLAUDE.md, choosing epidural directly should be equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present epidural as a direct option, not only a fallback
- **Proposed change**: "Epidural can provide effective relief, whether you try other approaches first or go directly to it."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-3: Induction implies epidural is expected
- **Location**: WHEN AN EPIDURAL MAKES SENSE, "Induction or augmentation" paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "Many find these harder to manage without medication."
- **Issue**: Normalizes epidural during induction and frames managing without as unusually difficult. Per CLAUDE.md, declining medication during induction should feel equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Add balancing language
- **Proposed change**: "Many find these harder to manage without medication, though many women successfully use non-pharmacological coping techniques like hydrotherapy, movement, and breathing through augmented labor."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-4: "Gold standard" language
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE: BENEFITS, "Pain Relief That Actually Works" heading
- **Flagged text**: "Epidurals are the gold standard for a reason."
- **Issue**: "Gold standard" implies the benchmark against which all others are measured. Frames non-epidural approaches as lesser.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge effectiveness without hierarchy language
- **Proposed change**: "Epidurals are the most effective pharmacological pain relief option for labor, and the evidence supports that."
- **Your decision**: [ X] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 14-5: Pain statistics only show high-pain side
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE: BENEFITS, "Pain Relief That Actually Works" section
- **Flagged text**: "For context: 30-35% of women describe unmedicated labor pain as 'intense,' and 15-20% call it 'overwhelmingly unbearable.' Epidurals reliably address this."
- **Issue**: Omits that 10-15% report minimal/mild pain and 35-40% report moderate pain. Skews framing toward "labor pain is terrible, epidurals fix it."
- **Recommendation**: Add the full range of pain experiences
- **Proposed change**: "For context: research indicates 10-15% of laboring people report minimal or mild pain, 35-40% experience moderate pain, 30-35% describe it as 'intense,' and 15-20% call it 'overwhelmingly unbearable.' For those in the higher pain categories, epidurals reliably address this."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

Other items: when discussing epidural fever - should give statistics for mother having a fever without epidural. Change title of section from "What they dont tell you" to "Drawbacks of an Epidural" or something like that. Also, we should mention possible complications for epidurals for moms resulting from mistakes (describe the procedure / where pain meds are going and discuss statistics / possibility of the anesthesiologist messing up and injecting where they're not supposed to and causing harm)
Should definitely reference / link to the intervention cascade chapter at least the first time we reference it here
Explain what hypotension means quickly for the reader
First stage: 43-51 additional minutes with modern techniques Second stage: 15-82 additional minutes These are averages - individual variation is enormous. This sentence is missing a period before "Second"
Epidurals increase the risk of tearing due to not being able to basically feel feedback from your body when pushing (research / discuss this in the chapter)

---

### Chapter 17: Labor Induction

**Edits made**: Added "Declining Induction" section, added "Big Baby" concerns with 60% false-positive ultrasound stat, expanded birth ball/castor oil/acupuncture/EPO/raspberry leaf/nipple stimulation with research data, rewrote "Our Take" and Bottom Line for autonomy-respecting tone, added cross-refs to cascade/pitocin/fetal monitoring/informed refusal chapters, added citations 15-19. No cost figures to audit.

#### Flag 17-1: "Why They Push Induction" heading
- **Location**: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU section, subsection heading
- **Flagged text**: "Why They Push Induction"
- **Issue**: "Push" frames provider recommendations as coercive by default, creating adversarial framing.
- **Recommendation**: Reword heading
- **Proposed change**: "Why Providers often Recommend Induction"
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-2: Scare-quote framing of hospital perspective
- **Location**: WHAT HOSPITALS TELL YOU section, final line
- **Flagged text**: "You'll typically hear that natural methods have 'no evidence' and that medical induction is the safest path once you're past due."
- **Issue**: Scare quotes on "no evidence" frames hospitals as dismissive/misleading. Could undermine trust for readers choosing medical induction.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to be more neutral
- **Proposed change**: "You may hear that natural methods lack strong evidence and that medical induction is the most reliable path once you're past due. The full picture is more nuanced."
- **Your decision**: [x ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-3: "Waiting indefinitely isn't safe"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Waiting indefinitely isn't safe."
- **Issue**: Creates a straw man — no one advocates waiting indefinitely. Implicitly frames families wanting to wait longer as reckless.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge nuance
- **Proposed change**: "The evidence does show that risks increase with time, particularly after 42 weeks."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: should be reworded to emphasize that 42 weeks is in the normal range (36-44 weeks) / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 17-4: "Accept enhanced monitoring"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section, recommendation 3
- **Flagged text**: "Accept enhanced monitoring."
- **Issue**: Directive language — "accept" frames monitoring as compliance rather than choice. CLAUDE.md says never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reword
- **Proposed change**: "Enhanced monitoring is available and can help you track baby's well-being."
- **Your decision**: [ x] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

Other items - dont say that castor oil isn't worth it, just warn about risks of diarrhea and explain its efficacy in inducing labor
We should mention that the average, normal range of time for a pregnancy is 36-44 weeks (this is what we learned in Bradley method course - not sure what the source is here but find it and utilize statistics to find the mean/standard deviation). It's not abnormal to bust your due date (especially as a first time mom). Once you get to 41 weeks you should continue monitoring your baby's activity closely and your doctor may want you to come in every day, but don't feel pressured to be induced unless that is what you want. 
Should explain more in-depth what happens with advanced pregnancy / why it can be dangerous due to changing conditions in womb / other science behind it (eg placenta will start to die off / whatever happens here - I forget). This should be before "why they push induction"

### Chapter 29: Newborn Screening

**Edits made**: Added "Declining or Partial Screening" section (legal landscape, partial screening, independent testing, warning signs), added "Costs" section ($15-$75 state fees, $50-$200 hospital, $100-$500 private), updated NJ storage tense, added cross-ref to infant pain management chapter. No research report available.


#### Flag 29-1: "We recommend doing it"
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "We recommend doing it, but be informed about what it involves."
- **Issue**: Directly tells the reader what to do. Declining must read as equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present as informed choice
- **Proposed change**: "Most families choose to do it, but some decline — either way, being informed about what it involves helps you make the right decision for your family."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 29-2: "the medical benefits outweigh the brief pain"
- **Location**: THE EVIDENCE, line 24
- **Flagged text**: "This doesn't mean you shouldn't do the test—the medical benefits outweigh the brief pain."
- **Issue**: "You shouldn't" is directive. Presupposes reader's risk/benefit values.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: "For families who choose the screening, being prepared for the pain — and knowing how to reduce it — makes the experience easier."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 29-3: "Do the newborn screening"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 103
- **Flagged text**: "Do the newborn screening."
- **Issue**: Direct imperative command. "Our Take" can have perspective but must respect autonomy.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to express perspective while respecting autonomy
- **Proposed change**: "We lean toward screening. The conditions it catches are rare but devastating when missed, and early treatment makes a life-changing difference."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 29-4: "The test is a yes"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 115
- **Flagged text**: "The test is a yes. How it's done matters too."
- **Issue**: Declares the decision as made. Dismisses declining as not worth considering.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to acknowledge both paths
- **Proposed change**: "Whatever you decide, how it's done matters too."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 29-5: "The screening is still worth doing"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 111
- **Flagged text**: "The screening is still worth doing—you're just protecting your child's genetic privacy."
- **Issue**: Presupposes reader's values. Frames declining as not worth considering.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral
- **Proposed change**: "If you choose screening, requesting sample destruction afterward protects your child's genetic privacy without giving up the test's benefits."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 29-6: Quick Answer omits declining as option
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "The benefits are significant. However, the procedure is painful..."
- **Issue**: Quick Answer never mentions declining as an option. Per CLAUDE.md, declining must be equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Add declining as a visible option in Quick Answer
- **Proposed change**: "The newborn screening test checks for rare but serious conditions that are treatable if caught early. Most families choose to screen. Some decline — citing pain, privacy concerns, or preference for independent testing. This chapter covers both paths so you can decide what's right for your family."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 31: Infant Pain Management

**Edits made**: Reframed "better alternative" headings to "non-pharmacological options," replaced ranked First/Second/Third choice hierarchy with equal-weight option presentation, expanded non-breastfeeding family coverage, added "Declining Pain Interventions" section, rewrote circumcision pain section with cross-ref to ch-circumcision, replaced prescriptive "Philosophy" closing with neutral "Questions to Consider." No cost figures; no research report.

#### Flag 31-1: Precautionary principle as default wisdom
- **Location**: One-Page Overview, paragraph 3
- **Flagged text**: "the precautionary principle suggests erring on the side of caution—especially when less-studied interventions can be avoided entirely"
- **Issue**: Frames using pain interventions as risky and avoidance as the default wise choice. Positions declining as the smarter option.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present as one valid lens among several
- **Proposed change**: "the precautionary principle is one framework some families use when weighing these decisions — others prioritize reducing immediate discomfort. Both approaches reflect thoughtful parenting."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-2: "What They Tell You" adversarial framing (acetaminophen)
- **Location**: Acetaminophen section heading
- **Flagged text**: "What They Tell You" / "Tylenol is safe for infants and has been used for decades."
- **Issue**: "What They Tell You" sets up adversarial dynamic — implying providers give incomplete/misleading info. Undermines trust for families who follow provider recommendations.
- **Recommendation**: Change heading to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: Change heading to "The Standard Position"
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-3: "What They Tell You" adversarial framing (sugar water)
- **Location**: Sugar Water section heading
- **Flagged text**: "What They Tell You" / "Sugar water is safe and helps reduce pain during procedures."
- **Issue**: Same adversarial framing as 31-2. Creates us-vs-them dynamic with medical providers.
- **Recommendation**: Change heading to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: Change heading to "The Standard Position"
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-4: Pharmaceutical conspiracy implication
- **Location**: Acetaminophen, "What this actually means"
- **Flagged text**: "there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund research that might reveal problems with a generic, inexpensive medication"
- **Issue**: Implies suppressed research. Could read as dismissing families who trust provider recommendations.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present funding reality without conspiratorial framing
- **Proposed change**: "Comprehensive long-term studies are expensive and complex to design, and funding for research on widely available generic medications is limited."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-5: Burden of proof framing
- **Location**: Acetaminophen, end of "What the Research Shows"
- **Flagged text**: "The precautionary principle suggests that when dealing with developing brains, the burden of proof should be on demonstrating safety, not on parents to prove harm."
- **Issue**: Frames the situation as though safety has not been demonstrated, when major health organizations maintain acetaminophen is safe for appropriate use.
- **Recommendation**: Present precautionary principle as one framework, not the correct one
- **Proposed change**: "Some families apply the precautionary principle here, preferring to minimize exposure until more definitive research is available. Others find the existing safety record and organizational endorsements sufficient. Both positions are reasonable given the current state of the evidence."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 31-6: "Making procedures easier for providers" implication
- **Location**: Sugar Water, "May mask pain rather than reduce it"
- **Flagged text**: "This raises ethical questions about whether we're helping babies feel less pain or just making procedures easier for providers to perform."
- **Issue**: Implies providers use sugar water for their own convenience rather than baby's benefit. Adversarial framing.
- **Recommendation**: Present finding neutrally without attributing motivation
- **Proposed change**: "This raises questions about the mechanism — whether sucrose reduces the experience of pain or primarily reduces the outward expression of pain."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 21: Pushing Positions

**Edits made**: No content edits needed — no cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research report. Content gap check passed (positions presented with equal weight, bottom line respects autonomy). Minor gap: chapter is hospital-centric in framing; birth center/home birth settings only briefly mentioned.

#### Flag 21-1: Adversarial provider framing (lithotomy origin)
- **Location**: THE SCIENCE section, "The Problem with Lying Flat"
- **Flagged text**: "The lithotomy position—lying on your back with legs up in stirrups—became standard in hospitals not because it's best for women, but because it's convenient for providers."
- **Issue**: Frames providers as prioritizing convenience over patient wellbeing. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to be neutral about historical development
- **Proposed change**: "The lithotomy position—lying on your back with legs up in stirrups—became standard in hospitals due to various factors including provider visibility, monitoring equipment compatibility, and medical training traditions."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-2: "Let's be honest" adversarial framing
- **Location**: WHY HOSPITALS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK, "Provider Convenience" subsection
- **Flagged text**: "Let's be honest: the lithotomy position is convenient for the person catching the baby. They can see everything clearly, have easy access for interventions, and don't have to adjust their position. This isn't necessarily your provider being lazy or uncaring—it's what they were trained to do..."
- **Issue**: "Let's be honest" suggests hidden truth; defensive acknowledgment that providers aren't "lazy or uncaring" implies that's a reasonable interpretation. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Rewrite to focus on systemic factors without implying provider motives
- **Proposed change**: "The lithotomy position offers certain advantages from a clinical perspective: clear visibility, straightforward access for interventions if needed, and consistency with standard medical training. Understanding these factors can help you have productive conversations with your care team about alternatives."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-3: Dismissive of provider reasoning
- **Location**: WHY HOSPITALS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK, "Liability Culture" subsection
- **Flagged text**: "But 'we've always done it this way' isn't a medical reason."
- **Issue**: Dismisses provider perspective. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Delete or reframe neutrally
- **Proposed change**: "You can ask about the specific medical rationale for position recommendations in your particular situation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-4: "Genuine" emergency implication
- **Location**: HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR ALTERNATIVES, closing line
- **Flagged text**: "Remember: You have the right to choose your position unless there's a genuine medical emergency."
- **Issue**: Word "genuine" subtly implies providers might claim false emergencies. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: "Remember: You have the right to choose your position, and your care team can help you understand if there are medical factors to consider in your specific situation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 21-5: Implied lack of provider support
- **Location**: IF YOU GET PUSHBACK, closing line
- **Flagged text**: "Remember: This is your body and your birth. You have the right to make decisions about your position—and to be supported in those decisions."
- **Issue**: "And to be supported" carries undertone that providers might not be supportive. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Minor reword to maintain empowerment without adversarial undertone
- **Proposed change**: "Remember: This is your body and your birth. You have the right to make informed decisions about your position."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 22: Perineal Support

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) changed directive "Ask your provider or nurse to apply warm compresses" to "You can request warm compresses" (2) changed "consider this a red flag" re: high episiotomy rates to neutral "may not be following current guidelines." No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter well-aligned with CLAUDE.md overall.

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

---

### Chapter 24: Hospital Admission

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) softened "declining everything isn't the goal" to acknowledge all approaches as valid (2) removed directive "try to stay calm and trust the process" in emergency section. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter already strong on autonomy and informed choice.

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

---

### Chapter 25: IV vs Hep Lock

**Edits made**: Fixed 1 cross-reference — changed "see Eating/Drinking section" to proper `@ch-eating-drinking` reference. No cost figures. No matching research.

**Content gap note**: Entire chapter frames hep lock as the preferred choice. Missing: why someone might prefer continuous IV (peace of mind, already planning epidural, not concerned about mobility). "Our Take" is entirely one-sided.

#### Flag 25-1: Directive language in Quick Answer
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "Most low-risk women don't need continuous IV fluids—request a hep lock instead."
- **Issue**: Directive language ("request... instead") tells readers what to do. Per CLAUDE.md, never frame as "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reword to present as option
- **Proposed change**: "Most low-risk women don't need continuous IV fluids—a hep lock is an option that preserves mobility while maintaining access."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 25-2: Directive language in Our Take
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, opening line
- **Flagged text**: "Request a hep lock unless you have a specific medical reason for continuous fluids."
- **Issue**: Direct command ("Request"). Per CLAUDE.md, never frame as "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as conditional choice
- **Proposed change**: "If you want a hep lock and don't have a specific medical reason for continuous fluids, here's how to ask:"
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 25-3: Framing one choice as superior
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, closing line
- **Flagged text**: "This is a small request that makes a real difference in your ability to move and labor actively."
- **Issue**: Frames hep lock as objectively better. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge as one valid preference
- **Proposed change**: "If mobility during early labor is important to you, this is one way to preserve that option."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 25-4: Subtle gatekeeping
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, final sentence
- **Flagged text**: "Most providers will agree if you ask."
- **Issue**: Implies need for provider agreement. Per CLAUDE.md, never gatekeep.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to empower reader
- **Proposed change**: "Many hospitals will accommodate this preference."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

---

### Chapter 26: Eating and Drinking During Labor

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Chapter presents eating/drinking as the evidence-based preferred choice but doesn't give equal treatment to fasting as a valid option. No acknowledgment that some may prefer to fast for personal, cultural, or comfort reasons.

#### Flag 26-1: "Outdated" framing
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "The old rule of 'nothing by mouth' during labor is outdated."
- **Issue**: Frames NPO policy as wrong rather than presenting both approaches. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Soften to neutral historical context
- **Proposed change**: "The traditional rule of 'nothing by mouth' during labor originated in the 1940s, though current evidence supports different options for low-risk women."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 26-2: "Needs fuel" directive
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "Your body is doing hard work—it needs fuel."
- **Issue**: Directive language suggesting eating is necessary. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as option-based
- **Proposed change**: "Your body is doing hard work—some find fuel helpful during this process."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 26-3: Direct commands in Our Take
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, opening line
- **Flagged text**: "Eat lightly in early labor. Drink throughout labor. Listen to your body."
- **Issue**: Direct commands ("Eat", "Drink"). Per CLAUDE.md, never frame as "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as what many choose
- **Proposed change**: "Many women find light eating in early labor and drinking throughout labor works well for them."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 26-4: Directive closing
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, final line
- **Flagged text**: "Your body knows how to do this. Feed it."
- **Issue**: Prescriptive command that frames eating as the right choice. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Replace with autonomy-respecting conclusion
- **Proposed change**: "Whether you choose to eat, drink only, or fast, the choice is yours to make based on what feels right for your body and circumstances."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

---

### Chapter 36: Directed vs Spontaneous Pushing

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Evidence section lists problems with directed pushing but doesn't list potential benefits (e.g., helpful for those who want structure, may help coordinate pushing efforts). One-sided evidence presentation.

#### Flag 36-1: Framing one choice as superior
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "Spontaneous pushing (following your body's urges) is generally better than directed 'purple pushing' (coached, breath-holding pushes)."
- **Issue**: "Generally better" frames spontaneous as superior. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Present both as valid approaches
- **Proposed change**: "Spontaneous pushing (following your body's urges) and directed pushing (coached breath-holding) represent two different approaches, each with different outcomes documented in research."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 36-2: Directive + adversarial framing in Our Take
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, opening lines
- **Flagged text**: "If you don't have an epidural, push when and how your body tells you. Don't let someone count to 10 while you hold your breath until you're purple."
- **Issue**: Directive commands ("push when...") and adversarial framing ("Don't let someone"). Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives and never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe to support choice without adversarial tone
- **Proposed change**: "If you don't have an epidural, many families choose to push when and how their body signals. You can decline coached counting if you prefer to follow your own rhythm."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 36-3: One-sided closing
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, final line

- **Recommendation**: Replace with inclusive statement
- **Proposed change**: "Whether you choose spontaneous pushing, directed pushing, or a combination, you have the right to make that decision based on what feels right for your birth."

### Chapter 27: First Bath Timing

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

**Content gap note**: Chapter strongly favors delayed bathing without acknowledging families who might choose earlier bathing for cultural, personal, or bonding reasons. Missing perspective on why some families prefer early bathing.

#### Flag 27-1: Directive language in Quick Answer
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "Delay your baby's first bath for at least 24 hours—ideally longer."
- **Issue**: Directive language telling readers what to do. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informed choice
- **Proposed change**: "Many families choose to delay their baby's first bath for at least 24 hours—some wait even longer."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 27-2: Directive Our Take opening
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 34
- **Flagged text**: "Tell the hospital you want to delay the first bath."
- **Issue**: Command language assumes this is the only valid choice. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Present as one valid approach
- **Proposed change**: "If you choose to delay the first bath, let the hospital know your preference."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 27-3: Dismisses early bathing
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "There's no medical reason to wash it off immediately."
- **Issue**: Dismisses the choice to bathe earlier without acknowledging families who might prefer it (cultural practices, personal preference). Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge both approaches exist
- **Proposed change**: "The choice of when to bathe is yours—recent research shows potential benefits to waiting."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 28: Placenta Options

**Edits made**: 2 minor direct fixes — (1) softened dismissive "The evidence for placenta consumption is weak, but it's your choice. Just know the benefits are mostly anecdotal" to "The evidence for placenta consumption is limited—benefits are primarily anecdotal rather than scientifically proven. You can make an informed choice based on what feels right for your family." (2) softened directive "go for it—just don't rely on it" to "you can pursue it while being aware that the evidence doesn't support the claimed benefits."

*No tone flags — clean chapter after direct fixes.*

### Chapter 30: Hearing Test

**Edits made**: Added "REASONS SOME FAMILIES DECLINE OR DELAY" section covering families preferring minimal intervention, false positive anxiety, pediatrician-based testing preference, and cultural/religious considerations. This was a content gap fix — the chapter previously presented no reasons anyone might decline.

#### Flag 30-1: "Do it" in Quick Answer
- **Location**: THE QUICK ANSWER, line 5
- **Flagged text**: "There's no real downside. Do it."
- **Issue**: Direct command telling readers what to do. Per CLAUDE.md, declining must be equally valid.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informed choice
- **Proposed change**: "There's no real downside, making this a screening most families choose to complete."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 30-2: "Just do it" in Our Take
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 46
- **Flagged text**: "Just do it."
- **Issue**: Direct command. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Express perspective while respecting autonomy
- **Proposed change**: "This is one we'd recommend without hesitation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 30-3: "Easy yeses" framing
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, line 48
- **Flagged text**: "This is one of the easy yeses."
- **Issue**: Dismisses the possibility that informed parents might have reasons to decline. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge strength of evidence while maintaining autonomy
- **Proposed change**: "The evidence strongly supports this screening, and it's one of the most straightforward decisions in newborn care."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 32: Pacifier Use

**Edits made**: 2 content gap fixes — (1) Quick Answer reframed to present both immediate and delayed pacifier introduction as equally valid choices (2) Our Take restructured with "Your timing options" format giving equal weight to breastfeeding families, formula families, and those choosing no pacifier. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

*No tone flags — clean chapter after content gap fixes.*

### Chapter 33: Rooming In

**Edits made**: None needed. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Chapter already well-aligned with CLAUDE.md philosophy — presents rooming-in and nursery use as equally valid choices.

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

### Chapter 34: Leaving the Hospital

**Edits made**: None — all issues identified were tone flags. No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 34-1: "Don't rush home" directive
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Don't rush home just because you can."
- **Issue**: Directive language telling readers what not to do. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as balanced consideration
- **Proposed change**: "Some families prefer to leave as soon as possible; others find value in using the full stay. Both approaches are valid."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 34-2: "Don't stay longer than you want" directive
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "Don't stay longer than you want to, either."
- **Issue**: Same directive pattern in opposite direction. Per CLAUDE.md, present choices without commands.
- **Recommendation**: Fold into the rewritten passage above
- **Proposed change**: (Covered by Flag 34-1 rewrite — both directives replaced with balanced framing)
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 37: Water Birth

**Edits made**: 4 cost fixes for same-number ranges — birth center `$1,000-$1,000` → `$4,000-$8,000`, home midwife `$1,000-$1,000` → `$4,000-$8,000`, hospital tub `$100-$100` → `$200-$500`, reusable pool `$100-$100` → `$200-$400` and liners `$10-$10` → `$20-$40`. No cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 37-1: Our Take promotes water birth as superior
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section, opening
- **Flagged text**: "Water birth is one of the most evidence-based comfort measures available for labor."
- **Issue**: Frames water birth as superior to other comfort measures. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as one of several options
- **Proposed change**: "Water birth is a well-researched comfort option that some families find highly effective during labor."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 37-2: Institutional criticism
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "The fact that many hospitals restrict water birth despite the evidence says more about institutional inertia than about safety."
- **Issue**: Frames hospital policies as irrational. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives — hospitals may have valid operational/liability reasons.
- **Recommendation**: Reword to neutral framing
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital policies on water birth vary widely. Some restrict it due to liability concerns, staffing considerations, or interpretation of the evidence — while others actively offer it."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 37-3: Prescriptive "should" statements
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "If water birth appeals to you, you should have access to it."
- **Issue**: "You should" is directive language. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as informational
- **Proposed change**: "If water birth appeals to you, it's worth exploring your options — whether at a birth center, at home, or by looking for hospitals that offer it."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 38: VBAC

**Edits made**: Reverted agent's bad edit — agent changed "the evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option" to "VBAC should be the default recommendation" (more prescriptive, not less). Restored to: "The evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option for most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean." Also softened "optimal choice" to "well-supported choice." Multiple cost fixes applied by agent (2026 ranges verified). No matching research report.

#### Flag 38-1: "Should be the default recommendation"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, opening paragraph (REVERTED — no longer in text)
- **Flagged text**: "VBAC should be the default recommendation for most women" (this was the agent's bad edit, now reverted)
- **Issue**: Prescriptive language. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Status**: FIXED — reverted to "The evidence strongly supports VBAC as an excellent option"
- **Your decision**: No action needed (already fixed)

#### Flag 38-2: "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" is "harmful"
- **Location**: OUR TAKE, second paragraph
- **Flagged text**: "'Once a cesarean, always a cesarean' is outdated and harmful."
- **Issue**: "Harmful" is a strong value judgment that may alienate families who chose repeat cesarean. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Soften to factual framing
- **Proposed change**: "'Once a cesarean, always a cesarean' is a 1916 statement that referred to a surgical technique no longer in use. Modern evidence supports a more nuanced approach."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 40: Childbirth Education

**Edits made**: Multiple cost fixes to 2026 ranges — Bradley `$100-500` → `$200-600`, Hypnobabies `$100-400` → `$150-500` (self-study `$165` → `$195`), HypnoBirthing `$100-350` → `$150-450`, Lamaze `$100-300` → `$100-400`, Pink Kit `$10-120` → `$15-150`, Birthing From Within `$150-400` → `$200-500`, doula context `$100-2,500` → `$800-3,500`. No cross-references, no matching research.

#### Flag 40-1: Hospital class dismissal
- **Location**: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU section
- **Flagged text**: "Hospital childbirth classes are designed to make you a compliant patient, not an informed decision-maker."
- **Issue**: Dismisses hospital education as indoctrination. Per CLAUDE.md, respect all perspectives.
- **Recommendation**: Reframe to neutral comparison
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital childbirth classes tend to focus on what to expect at that specific facility and how to work within their protocols. Independent classes often cover a wider range of options and decision-making frameworks."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 40-2: Absolute statement about class outcomes
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section
- **Flagged text**: "A hospital class alone won't get you there."
- **Issue**: Presents as fact. Some families find hospital classes sufficient. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Soften to perspective
- **Proposed change**: "Hospital classes are a starting point, but many families find that supplementing with independent education deepens their preparation."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 40-3: "Don't skip this" directive
- **Location**: OUR TAKE section, closing
- **Flagged text**: "Don't skip this. The research is clear: education changes outcomes."
- **Issue**: Direct command. Per CLAUDE.md, never "you should."
- **Recommendation**: Reframe as evidence-based perspective
- **Proposed change**: "The research consistently shows that childbirth education improves outcomes and satisfaction — it's one of the most impactful investments you can make in your birth experience."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

#### Flag 40-4: Budget dismissal
- **Location**: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS section
- **Flagged text**: "If budget is a concern, free resources exist — but they're not the same as a structured course."
- **Issue**: Dismisses free resources as inferior. Per CLAUDE.md, equal weight for all choices.
- **Recommendation**: Acknowledge free resources as valid
- **Proposed change**: "If budget is a concern, free resources like Evidence Based Birth, YouTube-based courses, and library materials can provide solid education. Structured paid courses may offer more depth and personal support, but free options have helped many families feel well-prepared."
- **Your decision**: [ ] Approve / [ ] Modify: _____________ / [ ] Reject

### Chapter 99: Resources

**Edits made**: 1 minor edit — "Last reviewed: 2024" updated to "Last reviewed: 2026." No cost figures, no cross-references, no matching research. Resource links and descriptions well-balanced.

*No tone flags — clean chapter.*

---

Other edits:
For the chapter about when to go to the hospital - let's change it to The Stages of Labor (When to go to the Hospital) in parentheses.
In this chapter we should also discuss all the actions that the baby takes in the womb to facilitate labor / be born. Baby is an active participant in the process - discuss what actions they take and how hard they work to help mom with the birthing process (I dont remember specifics here but I remember learning about it in Bradley method course and thought it was awesome)
