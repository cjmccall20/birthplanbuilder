## Red Flag Answers

Be cautious if your provider says:
- "We don't do that here" (without explanation)
- "You don't need to worry about that"
- "Let's see how things go" (on everything)
- "Most women change their mind" (dismissively)
- "That's not safe" (without citing evidence)

A good provider will:
