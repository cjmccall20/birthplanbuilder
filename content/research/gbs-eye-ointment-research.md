# Research Notes: GBS Risk Stratification and Erythromycin Eye Ointment Effects

**Date**: January 26, 2026
**Purpose**: Investigate stratified GBS risk factors and potential microbiome effects of erythromycin eye ointment

---

## Topic 1: GBS Risk Factors and Stratified Risk Beyond the 1:200 Baseline

### Background: The 1:200 Baseline Risk

The commonly cited "1 in 200" risk figure refers to the transmission risk when mothers are colonized with GBS and do NOT receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). With antibiotic treatment, this risk drops dramatically to approximately 1 in 4,000 babies.

**Source**: [Cleveland Clinic - Group B Strep In Pregnancy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/group-b-strep)

### Current Overall Incidence Rates

Thanks to universal screening and antibiotic prophylaxis programs:
- Early 1990s: 1.7-1.8 cases per 1,000 live births
- 2017: 0.22 cases per 1,000 live births
- 2020: 0.2 cases per 1,000 live births

This represents an **over 80% reduction** in early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS).

- [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

### Understanding the Transmission Cascade

In the absence of any intervention, the risk calculation works as follows:
- ~20% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS
- ~50% of babies born to colonized mothers become colonized
- ~1-2% of colonized babies develop clinical infection
- **Net result**: Approximately 1 per 1,000 births (0.1%) without any screening or treatment

**Source**: [NCBI StatPearls - Streptococcus Group B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553143/)

### Specific High-Risk Factors

#### 1. **Race and Ethnicity**

African American mothers and infants face **twice the risk** of GBS disease compared to white populations:

- Heavy GBS colonization is more frequent among African American women
- This may explain higher rates of both early-onset and late-onset disease
- In one study, **Black race had an odds ratio of 1.81** for EOGBS in babies born to mothers with negative GBS screening
- GBS disease is "substantially more often" in African American infants, even after controlling for other risk factors like low birth weight and prematurity

- [PMC - Risk factors for Group B streptococcal disease in neonates](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5280520/)

#### 2. **Maternal Age**

Younger mothers have significantly elevated risk:

- Maternal age **<18 years**: Odds ratio of **2.63** for EOGBS
- Maternal age **18-35 years**: Odds ratio of **1.94** for EOGBS
- Reference group: Mothers >35 years (lowest risk)

Notably, maternal age <18 years and Black race were identified as the **strongest predictors** of EOGBS in infants born to mothers with negative screening.

- [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

#### 3. **Prematurity**

Preterm infants (born before 37 weeks) have a **3-fold increased risk** of early-onset disease compared to term infants.

**Source**: [PMC - Epidemiology of Group B Streptococcal Disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC88893/)

#### 4. **Other Obstetric Risk Factors**

Risk increases with:
- Prolonged rupture of membranes (≥18 hours before delivery)
- Intrapartum fever (>100.4°F / 38°C)
- Chorioamnionitis (placental/amniotic fluid infection)
- Urinary tract infection during pregnancy
- Previous infant with GBS disease
- Very low birth weight

**Sources**:

- [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

#### 5. **Heavy vs. Light Colonization**

The **inoculum (number of organisms)** in the maternal genital tract is the main factor determining transmission likelihood:

- Heavily colonized mothers are significantly more likely to have colonized or infected neonates
- Heavy colonization is more common in African American women, partially explaining racial disparities

**Source**: [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

### Risk in "Low-Risk" Mothers (Key Finding)

An important 2002 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found:

- Women with **negative prenatal screening cultures** but who had **one or more risk factors**: Incidence of **0.9 cases per 1,000 births**
- Women who were **colonized prenatally** but had **no risk factors**: Incidence of **5.1 cases per 1,000 births**

**This shows that colonization status matters more than individual risk factors.**

### Limitations of Current Screening

Despite universal screening protocols:

- **60-80% of EOGBS cases** now occur in infants born to mothers who tested **negative** for GBS between 35-37 weeks gestation
- **62%** of women whose newborns developed early-onset disease had **no evidence of clinical risk factors**
- 40% of pregnant women with GBS-infected children (in Swedish study) had **no identifiable risk factors**

**Sources**:
- [PMC - Risk factors for Group B streptococcal disease in neonates](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5280520/)
- [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

### Why False Negatives Occur

- Culture sensitivity is imperfect
- GBS can be acquired between screening (35-37 weeks) and delivery
- Possible issues with specimen collection, timing, transport, or laboratory processing
- Light colonization may not be detected but can still cause disease

**Source**: [NCBI StatPearls - Group B Streptococcus and Pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482443/)

### Risk for Mothers WITHOUT High-Risk Factors (Answer to User's Question)

Based on the available research:

1. **If mother screens negative and has no risk factors**: The exact risk is not precisely quantified in the literature, but can be estimated from:
   - Overall population incidence with screening/prophylaxis: **0.2-0.22 per 1,000** (1 in ~4,500-5,000)
   - Many of these cases (60%+) occur in mothers with negative screening
   - But this group includes mothers who may have had false negatives

2. **If mother screens positive but has no additional risk factors**:
   - Without IAP: Approximately **5.1 per 1,000** (1 in 196, close to the 1:200 figure)
   - With IAP: Risk drops by approximately 20-fold

3. **The "1 in 200" figure appears to be an average** across all colonized mothers, not accounting for specific risk stratification.

### Microbiome Research Connection

Emerging research suggests that the composition and dynamics of the maternal microbiome during pregnancy may influence GBS colonization risk, particularly in African American women. Preliminary data indicates that prenatal antibiotic exposure (which is more common among African American women) may paradoxically **increase the risk** for GBS colonization.

## Topic 2: Erythromycin Eye Ointment and Infant Gut Microbiome

### Background: Current Practice

Erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment is:
- The **only FDA-approved prophylactic agent** for preventing ophthalmia neonatorum (eye infection) in the U.S.
- Recommended by the CDC and AAP for **all newborns** within 24 hours of birth
- **Mandated by law** in most U.S. states
- Applied topically to both eyes to prevent gonococcal and other bacterial eye infections

**Sources**:
- [AAO - Use of Erythromycin in Prevention of Ophthalmia Neonatorum](https://www.aao.org/education/clinical-statement/use-of-erythromycin-in-prevention-of-neonatal-opht)
- [Evidence Based Birth - Erythromycin Eye Ointment for Newborns](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/is-erythromycin-eye-ointment-always-necessary-for-newborns/)

### Does Topical Erythromycin Get Absorbed Systemically?

#### General Ophthalmic Drug Absorption

Research on ophthalmic drug delivery reveals:

- **Only 5-10% of topically applied eye medication** actually crosses the corneal barriers into the eye itself
- **Up to 80% of an administered eye drop** may enter systemic bloodstream through the nasal mucosa via nasolacrimal drainage
- **About 95% of the administered dose** is eliminated systemically via the conjunctiva and nasolacrimal duct
- For lipophilic drugs, **50-80% can be absorbed** into systemic circulation

**Sources**:
- [PMC - Systemic side effects of eye drops: a pharmacokinetic perspective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5153265/)
- [PMC - A Comprehensive Insight on Ocular Pharmacokinetics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5319401/)
- [MedX - Can Antibiotic Eye Drops Make You Feel Sick?](https://medx.it.com/can-antibiotic-eye-drops-make-you-feel-sick)

#### Mechanism: How Eye Medications Enter the Bloodstream

1. Excess fluid drains from the eye through the **nasolacrimal duct** into the nasal cavity
2. The **nasal mucosa is highly vascularized**, allowing rapid absorption
3. This route **bypasses first-pass metabolism** in the liver, making systemic absorption potentially more significant

**Source**: [PMC - Systemic side effects of eye drops: a pharmacokinetic perspective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5153265/)

#### Erythromycin-Specific Absorption in Neonates

The research on erythromycin eye ointment specifically shows:

- **"Predominantly local drug action with minimal systemic absorption"**
- **Topical ophthalmic bioavailability is <5%**
- "Systemic toxicity from ocular prophylaxis is exceedingly rare"

However, the neonatal eye has unique characteristics:
- **Neonatal conjunctiva is thinner and more vascular** than in older children/adults
- **Corneal epithelium has higher cell turnover rate**
- These factors could theoretically increase absorption, though quantitative data is limited

**Sources**:
- [NCBI StatPearls - Ophthalmia Neonatorum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551572/)
- [PMC - A Comprehensive Insight on Ocular Pharmacokinetics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5319401/)

#### Theoretical Concerns vs. Epidemiologic Data

- **Theoretical risk**: Absorbed erythromycin could cause GI upset or contribute to hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
- **Reality**: "Epidemiologic data have not demonstrated a causal relationship at ophthalmic dosing"
- Side effects are rare: occasional mild chemical conjunctivitis (transient redness/discharge)

**Sources**:
- [NCBI StatPearls - Ophthalmia Neonatorum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551572/)
- [AAO - Use of Erythromycin in Prevention of Ophthalmia Neonatorum](https://www.aao.org/education/clinical-statement/use-of-erythromycin-in-prevention-of-neonatal-opht)

### Studies on Erythromycin Eye Ointment Affecting Infant Microbiome

**Key Finding: No direct studies found.**

The research searches did not return any published studies specifically examining the impact of topical erythromycin eye ointment on infant gut microbiome development. This appears to be a **research gap**.

Possible reasons for lack of research:
1. The systemic absorption is considered minimal
2. The dose is very small compared to oral/IV antibiotics
3. Researchers may have assumed negligible impact
4. Focus has been on intrapartum antibiotics which involve much larger systemic doses

### Comparison: Oral/IV Erythromycin Effects on Infant Microbiome

Since no direct studies exist on ophthalmic erythromycin, it's useful to understand what systemic erythromycin does to the infant microbiome as a reference point:

#### Effects of Systemic Erythromycin and Other Antibiotics

**Immediate Effects:**
- **Decreases beneficial bacteria**: Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridiales, Ruminococcus
- **Increases pathogenic bacteria**: Enterobacteriaceae
- **Reduces overall bacterial diversity**

**Specific to Erythromycin and Macrolides:**
- Treatment with erythromycin (along with penicillin, ampicillin, and others) has been found to:
  - Increase percentage of potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae
  - Lower relative percentage of Bifidobacteriaceae, Bacilli, and Lactobacillales (beneficial)
- "Macrolide antibiotics cause **immediate and longer term damage**"
- Macrolide resistance genes can persist for **2-4 years** after treatment

**Duration-Dependent:**
- Each additional day of antibiotics is associated with lower concentrations of:
  - Obligate anaerobes (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, Bacteroides)
  - Butyrate-producers (Bifidobacteriaceae, Bacteroidaceae)

- [Oxford Academic - Antibiotic therapy in neonates and impact on gut microbiota](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/73/3/569/4652876)

#### Long-Term Health Consequences of Early Antibiotic Exposure

Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in early life has been associated with:
- Increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and fungal infections (short-term)
- Allergic diseases
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Inflammatory bowel disease

The **first 1000 days** (conception to age 2) is a critical window for gut microbiome establishment.

### Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis (IAP) for GBS: Well-Documented Microbiome Effects

Unlike erythromycin eye ointment, the effects of IV antibiotics given to mothers during labor (IAP for GBS) are **well-documented**:

#### Microbiome Alterations

- **Delayed expansion of Bifidobacterium** (normally the dominant colonizer) over first 12 weeks
- **Persistence of E. coli** (Escherichia)
- **Lower bacterial diversity** in exposed infants
- **Lower abundance of Actinobacteria** (especially Bifidobacteriaceae)
- **Higher abundance of Proteobacteria**

#### Duration of Effects

- At **1 month**: Significantly lower Bifidobacterium longum
- At **1 year**: The reduction in B. longum was **still sustained**
- Some studies show changes up to **90 days** of life
- Bacterial diversity reaches normal levels by **12 weeks** in some studies

#### Clinical Implications

- IAP has reduced early-onset GBS disease by **>80%** (major public health success)
- "Consistent observational evidence" shows IAP alters infant microbiome
- **Clinical consequences of these alterations are unknown**
- More research needed with longer follow-up periods

### Interesting Related Finding: Nasal Microbiome Effects

One pilot study examined the effect of antibiotic eye drops on the **nasal microbiome** (not gut) in healthy adults, suggesting that even topical ophthalmic antibiotics can affect local microbial communities through nasolacrimal drainage.

## Summary and Conclusions

### GBS Risk Stratification

1. **The 1:200 risk is indeed population-wide** among GBS-colonized mothers without IAP
2. **Specific groups with elevated risk**:
   - African American mothers/infants: 2x risk
   - Maternal age <18: 2.63x odds ratio
   - Preterm birth: 3x risk
   - Heavy colonization vs. light colonization

3. **Risk for low-risk mothers**:
   - Precise stratified risk data is limited
   - Women who are GBS-positive but have no other risk factors: ~5.1 per 1,000 without IAP
   - Women who are GBS-negative with risk factors: ~0.9 per 1,000
   - **Colonization status appears more important than individual risk factors**

4. **Current screening limitations**:
   - 60-80% of cases now occur in babies born to GBS-negative mothers
   - 62% of cases occur without identifiable risk factors
   - False negatives and timing issues contribute to this

### Erythromycin Eye Ointment and Microbiome

1. **Systemic absorption of ophthalmic drugs**:
   - General ophthalmic drugs: Up to 80% can enter bloodstream via nasolacrimal drainage
   - Erythromycin specifically: Described as "minimal systemic absorption" with "predominantly local action"
   - Neonatal eyes may be more permeable, but quantitative data lacking

2. **Direct evidence on gut microbiome effects**:
   - **No published studies found** examining erythromycin eye ointment impact on infant gut microbiome
   - This represents a **research gap**

3. **Systemic erythromycin (oral/IV) effects** (for comparison):
   - Clear evidence of microbiome disruption
   - Reduces beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus)
   - Increases pathogenic bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae)
   - Macrolide resistance genes persist 2-4 years
   - Associated with long-term health risks

4. **Intrapartum antibiotics (IAP) for GBS**:
   - Well-documented microbiome effects lasting up to 1 year
   - Public health benefit (80% reduction in EOGBS) outweighs concerns
   - Long-term clinical consequences remain unknown

5. **Clinical perspective**:
   - Epidemiologic data shows no causal link between ophthalmic erythromycin and systemic complications at typical doses
   - 2024 AAP statement supports "ongoing re-evaluation" of universal mandates
   - Risk-benefit assessment may differ for low-risk vs. high-risk infants

---

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

1. **Need for stratified GBS risk calculators** that account for:
   - Race/ethnicity
   - Maternal age
   - Colonization density
   - Specific obstetric factors

2. **Pharmacokinetic studies** on erythromycin eye ointment in neonates:
   - Quantify systemic absorption
   - Measure blood levels after standard prophylaxis
   - Compare absorption in term vs. preterm infants

3. **Microbiome studies** on ophthalmic antibiotics:
   - Prospective cohort comparing infants who receive vs. don't receive eye prophylaxis
   - Stool sampling at multiple timepoints (days, weeks, months)
   - Assessment of nasal and oral microbiomes (not just gut)

4. **Long-term follow-up** of infants exposed to various antibiotic regimens:
   - IAP for GBS
   - Erythromycin eye ointment
   - Direct neonatal antibiotic treatment
   - Combined exposures

5. **Alternative prophylaxis agents** for ophthalmia neonatorum:
   - Povidone-iodine (non-antibiotic)
   - Risk-based rather than universal approach
   - Maternal STI screening optimization
