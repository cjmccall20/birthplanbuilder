# Circumcision: Understanding the Evidence and Making an Informed Decision

A comprehensive guide to understanding what circumcision is, what the research actually shows, what health organizations recommend, and how to make an informed choice for your family.

## Introduction: The Decision Most Parents Don't Expect to Make

If you're a first-time parent, circumcision may feel like one of those routine newborn procedures—something hospitals do automatically. It's not. In most developed countries outside the United States, circumcision is not standard practice, and even in the U.S., rates are declining. Parents who understand the evidence often make different choices than those who haven't thought it through.

This guide walks through what circumcision actually is, what medical organizations recommend, what the research shows about benefits and risks, and how to make a decision that aligns with your values and your baby's specific circumstances.

## Part 1: What Is Circumcision?

### The Basic Procedure

Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin—the retractable tissue that covers the head (glans) of the penis. It's typically performed on newborns in the hospital, usually within the first few days of life.

The procedure takes about 5-10 minutes and is usually performed without general anesthesia. In some hospitals, local anesthetic may be offered; in others, it may not be. In Jewish tradition, circumcision (called "brit milah" or "bris") is performed on day 8 of life by a trained mohel, often with minimal or no pain management.

### What Is the Foreskin?

The foreskin is not a vestigial or unnecessary piece of tissue. It serves several functions:

**Protective function:** The foreskin covers and protects the sensitive glans of the penis during childhood and adulthood.

**Sensory function:** The foreskin contains fine-touch receptors called Meissner's corpuscles and is rich in specialized nerve endings, making it the most sensitive part of the external penis.

**Mechanical function:** During sexual activity, the foreskin retracts to expose the glans and moves back and forth, reducing friction and potentially reducing the need for additional lubrication.

**Developmental function:** In newborns, the foreskin is fused to the glans with a white substance called smegma, which protects the developing head of the penis. The foreskin naturally separates over time (typically between ages 3-5, though it can take longer).

### How It's Performed in Newborns

Several techniques are used to perform newborn circumcision:

**Gomco clamp:** The foreskin is drawn through a bell-shaped device; the clamp applies pressure to cut off blood flow, and the foreskin is cut away. This takes about 3-5 minutes.

**Mogen clamp:** A faster method using a hinged clamp that holds the foreskin while cutting. This typically takes about 1-2 minutes.

**Plastibell device:** A plastic ring is fitted under the foreskin; a ligature (thread) is tied around the foreskin above the ring, cutting off blood supply. The ring falls off within 5-8 days as the tissue dies and separates.

**Surgical knife:** The physician freehand cuts and then sutures the skin. This is less common in routine newborn circumcision but may be used in specific situations.

### Pain Management: A Significant Gap in Practice

Pain management for newborn circumcision is inconsistent and often inadequate.

According to research, anesthetic use for newborn circumcision varies widely:
- Some hospitals routinely offer local anesthetic
- Others offer it only if parents request it
- Still others do not offer any pain relief

When pain management is used, it typically involves:
- Dorsal penile nerve block (local anesthetic injection near the base of the penis)
- Ring block (anesthetic injected around the penis shaft)
- Topical anesthetic cream (though less effective than injection)
- Sucrose or other comfort measures

**What the research shows about pain:** Studies document that circumcision causes significant pain in newborns. The procedure increases heart rate, stress hormones, and blood pressure. Babies may cry intensely, or in some cases, go into shock and become unresponsive from the overwhelming experience.

Research published in The Lancet found that boys circumcised as infants had stronger pain responses to routine vaccinations months later, suggesting the early pain experience had lasting effects on pain processing.

Even when anesthetic is used, it doesn't completely eliminate pain, and infant neurological development means the pain is processed and stored in the nervous system.

## Part 2: Medical Organization Positions

Understanding what health organizations actually recommend—and what they don't—is crucial to informed decision-making.

### The American Academy of Pediatrics 2012 Position

The AAP's most recent position statement on circumcision (2012) is often misquoted. Here's what it actually says:

**What the AAP says:**
- The health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks
- The benefits are sufficient that insurance should cover the procedure
- The AAP does not recommend routine circumcision for all newborns

**What this actually means:** The AAP concluded that the evidence shows some health benefits exist. But benefits minus risks = small. Small enough that the AAP chose not to recommend the procedure universally. Instead, they left the decision to parents.

Dr. Andrew Freedman, who served on the task force that drafted the policy, clarified: "There's no right or wrong answer. There are some minimal benefits and some minimal risks. There's not enough benefit to say that you must do it, and there's not enough risk to say you can never do it."

The AAP's position is important to understand because it's not an endorsement. It's a neutral stance that acknowledges both sides have merit.

**Important caveat:** The AAP policy expired in 2017 and has not been updated. The 2012 statement remains their most recent guidance, even though it's over a decade old.

### The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)

ACOG has endorsed the AAP's position statement, adopting the same stance: acknowledging benefits, acknowledging risks, leaving the decision to parents.

### International Medical Organizations: A Very Different Picture

Outside the United States, the story is quite different. Major medical organizations in Europe, Australia, and other developed nations have taken a critical stance on routine infant circumcision.

**Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) - Netherlands:**
The KNMG concluded there is "no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene." The organization opposes non-therapeutic circumcision in children.

**Danish Medical Association (DMA):**
In 2020, the DMA stated: "From a medical and medical ethics perspective, the Danish Medical Association believes that the current practice of circumcising boys without a medical indication should cease." Their position emphasizes lack of health benefits sufficient to justify the risks, pain, and loss of normal anatomy.

**Swedish Medical Association:**
The Swedish Medical Association recommended setting twelve as the minimum age for circumcision and requiring a boy's consent.

**German Pediatric Organizations:**
The German Academy for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, the German Association for Pediatric Surgery, and the Professional Association of Pediatric and Adolescent Physicians all oppose routine non-medical infant circumcision.

**British Medical Association (BMA):**
The BMA stated that "parental preference alone does not constitute sufficient grounds for performing non-therapeutic male circumcision on a child unable to express his own view." The organization also noted that evidence of health benefits is insufficient to justify the procedure.

**European Association of Urology (EAU):**
The EAU does not recommend routine neonatal circumcision and notes that routine circumcision for cultural, religious, or hygienic reasons falls outside their clinical guidance.

### The Core Difference: US vs. Europe

American medicine emphasizes potential disease prevention. European medicine emphasizes actual disease prevalence. In countries where HPV vaccination prevents cervical cancer, where UTIs are treatable, and where penile cancer is extremely rare, routine circumcision doesn't make the same case.

**Key fact:** No major medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision of all male infants. No major medical organization recommends banning the procedure. They occupy the middle ground: it's an option, not a requirement.

---

## Part 3: The Claimed Benefits

Medical organizations haven't recommended routine circumcision because the benefits are compelling. They've recommended it (or endorsed parent choice) because some benefits exist. Here's what the research actually shows about each claimed benefit.

### Benefit #1: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Prevention

UTI prevention is the most solidly evidenced benefit of circumcision. The research shows a real effect.

**What the research shows:**
- Circumcision reduces UTI risk. Uncircumcised boys have approximately a 10-fold higher risk of UTI compared to circumcised boys in infancy.
- A systematic review found circumcision was associated with a significantly reduced risk of UTI (odds ratio = 0.13; p<0.001).
- The protective effect decreases with age: 9.9 times higher risk at infancy, 6.6-fold higher by ages 1-16, and 3.4-fold higher beyond age 16.

**But here's the crucial detail—the Number Needed to Treat (NNT):**

This is where the benefit becomes much smaller in practical terms.

- To prevent one UTI in a healthy boy, you need to circumcise approximately 100-111 boys
- In the first two years of life (when UTI risk is highest), the NNT is about 37-50
- To prevent one UTI serious enough to require hospitalization, approximately 195 boys need to be circumcised

**Risk context:**
- Overall UTI risk in healthy uncircumcised boys is about 1-2% by age 5
- Lifetime UTI risk is 32% in uncircumcised males and 8.8% in circumcised males (but most of these UTIs are minor and easily treated)
- UTIs in boys are almost always easily treated with antibiotics and rarely cause lasting damage with early treatment

**When circumcision matters more for UTI prevention:**
Boys at high risk for UTI derive greater benefit:
- Boys with recurrent UTIs: NNT = 11
- Boys with vesicoureteric reflux (urine backing up into kidneys): NNT = 4
- Boys with hydronephrosis (kidney swelling): NNT = 10 (vs. 83 in healthy boys)

**The bottom line on UTIs:** This is a real benefit, but for most healthy newborn boys, the number needed to treat is high. For boys with known urological abnormalities or a history of UTI, circumcision may be more medically justified.

### Benefit #2: HIV and STI Prevention

The HIV prevention claim requires careful understanding because it's based on specific research done in a specific context.

**What the research shows—in Africa:**

Three randomized controlled trials conducted in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda found that circumcision reduced the rate of HIV infection among heterosexual men by approximately 60%.

This finding was significant enough that WHO and UNAIDS recommended voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) to reduce heterosexual HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 2007, more than 27 million VMMC procedures have been performed in high-prevalence African countries.

**Why this matters in Africa:** These trials were conducted in settings with extremely high HIV prevalence, where heterosexual transmission is the primary route of infection, and where the procedure is performed on adolescents and adults (not newborns) with their consent.

**The critical limitations for other settings:**

1. **No evidence for male-to-female transmission:** The studies only measured infection in men. There is no direct evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of transmission from men to women. The WHO does not recommend circumcision as HIV prevention for this reason.

2. **No evidence for male-to-male transmission:** WHO does not recommend circumcision as protection against male-to-male transmission (receptive anal intercourse), as evidence is lacking.

3. **Population-level data contradicts the benefit:** While the randomized trials showed an effect, population-level data from African countries presents a different picture. In several African countries including Malawi, Rwanda, Cameroon, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Tanzania, circumcised men were actually more likely to be HIV infected than intact men. A meta-analysis of national survey data from 19 African countries showed no association between circumcision and HIV infection at the population level.

4. **Questions about the trial methodology:** In the Kenyan trial, five men became HIV-positive who reported no sexual activity before seroconversion, suggesting non-sexual transmission pathways. Some analysts argue that only about 43% of infections in the three trials were definitively sexually transmitted.

5. **Applicability to developed countries is unclear:** The research is from a specific context (high-prevalence heterosexual epidemic, adult/adolescent circumcision, immediate application). Whether these findings apply to newborn circumcision in low-prevalence developed countries is not established.

6. **Other STIs:** The research claims circumcision may prevent other STIs like herpes and HPV. However, the evidence is weaker than for HIV, and HPV vaccines (which prevent HPV-related cancers far more effectively than circumcision) are now widely available.

**The bottom line on HIV/STI prevention:** Circumcision may reduce HIV acquisition risk in heterosexual men in high-prevalence settings, but this benefit has not been demonstrated in developed countries. Condoms, PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), testing, and other prevention methods are far more effective. For newborn circumcision specifically, applying African HIV prevention data to prevent infection decades later in a child is speculative.

### Benefit #3: Penile Cancer Prevention

Penile cancer prevention is often cited, but the disease itself is so rare that this benefit has limited practical significance.

**How rare is penile cancer?**
- In developed countries (USA, Europe, Australia): less than 1 case per 100,000 men per year
- This represents less than 1% of all male cancers
- Globally in 2020: 36,068 cases diagnosed (on a global male population of about 4 billion)
- Average age at diagnosis: 60 years old

For comparison:
- Prostate cancer: 288,000 US cases per year
- Skin cancer (melanoma): 100,000 US cases per year
- Colorectal cancer: 150,000 US cases per year

**What the research shows about circumcision:**

A meta-analysis found that childhood/adolescent circumcision had a protective effect against invasive penile cancer (odds ratio = 0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.83).

However, this protective effect appears to be mediated by prevention of phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin), which is one of the strongest risk factors for penile cancer. When analyses were restricted to men with no history of phimosis, circumcision showed no protective effect.

**Risk factors for penile cancer that matter more:**
- Phimosis (11- to 64-fold increased risk)
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
- Smoking
- Poor genital hygiene
- History of STIs

**The bottom line on penile cancer:** Circumcision may provide some protection, but penile cancer is so rare that this translates to virtually no practical benefit for the average boy. HPV vaccination (Gardasil, Cervarix) prevents HPV-related penile cancer far more effectively and is recommended for all teens.

### Benefit #4: Phimosis Prevention

Phimosis—the inability to retract the foreskin—is sometimes cited as a reason for circumcision.

**What you should know:**

**Physiologic phimosis is normal in childhood.** In newborns, the foreskin is fused to the glans and cannot be retracted. This is not a problem; it's protective. The foreskin naturally separates over time (typically ages 3-5, sometimes longer).

**Pathologic phimosis (true phimosis requiring treatment) is rare.** Only about 1-2% of boys develop phimosis that causes symptoms or requires intervention.

**Treatment is not always circumcision.** When phimosis does develop and causes problems, non-surgical options exist:
- Topical corticosteroid creams (first-line treatment, effective in 75-90% of cases)
- Preputioplasty (a surgical technique that widens the foreskin without removing it)

**Circumcision for phimosis prevention is like appendectomy for appendicitis prevention:** you're removing a normal structure to prevent a rare condition.

## Part 4: The Risks and Complications

Circumcision is a surgical procedure, and all surgery carries risks. Most complications are minor, but serious complications can occur.

### Complication Rates

**Overall complication rate: 0-16%, with most studies reporting 1.5-3%**

The variation depends on how complications are defined and measured:
- Some studies count only complications requiring intervention
- Others count minor bleeding, minor infections, and minor cosmetic issues
- Complication rates also depend on provider experience and technique

**Common complications:**

**Bleeding:** This is the most frequent complication. In most cases, it's minimal and stops with gentle pressure.
- Occurs in about 0.5-2% of circumcisions
- In the U.S. Army hospital study of 100,157 circumcisions, 83 cases of hemorrhage required intervention (0.08%)

**Local infection:** Most reported complications in some studies.
- Occurs in about 0.5-1% of circumcisions
- Includes wound infections, which are usually treatable with antibiotics
- In one systematic review, 62 out of 100,000 boys developed infections serious enough to count as complications

**Meatal stenosis:** Narrowing of the urethral opening, potentially causing difficulty urinating.
- Occurs in about 0.3-1% of circumcisions
- More common with the Plastibell method
- May require surgical correction if causing symptoms

**Other complications (less common):**
- Haematoma (blood collection under the skin)
- Subcutaneous cysts
- Excessive skin removal
- Surgical trauma (cutting too much or too little tissue)
- Adhesions (foreskin re-adhering to the glans)

**Serious complications (rare but documented):**
- Necrotizing fasciitis (tissue-destroying infection)
- Gangrene
- Sepsis
- Meningitis (rare)
- Penile necrosis (tissue death)
- Death (extremely rare; reported in the medical literature but estimated at fewer than 1 per 500,000 circumcisions)

**Complications are less likely when:**
- The provider is experienced and well-trained
- The procedure is performed in a medical setting
- The circumcision is done in the newborn period (generally safer than later childhood)

### Pain and Its Consequences

Beyond surgical complications, circumcision involves significant pain.

**What happens during the procedure:**
- Circumcision causes extreme pain
- Pain increases heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormone (cortisol) levels
- Some infants cry intensely; others go into a shutdown/shock state and become unresponsive

**Long-term effects of infant pain:**
Research shows that pain during infancy affects how the nervous system processes pain later:
- Boys circumcised as infants had stronger pain responses to routine vaccinations months later
- This difference was significant in terms of facial expressions, crying time, and pain assessments
- The altered pain response suggests that early pain experience changes pain processing

**The role of anesthesia:**
- Anesthesia reduces but does not eliminate pain
- Infant neurological development means the pain is still processed and stored
- Not all hospitals routinely offer anesthesia

### Loss of Functional Tissue: Sensitivity Research

The sensitivity question is complicated and contested in the research literature.

**What the foreskin contains:**
The foreskin is composed of specialized tissue with:
- Fine-touch receptors (Meissner's corpuscles)
- Free nerve endings for temperature and pain sensation
- Erogenous tissue with specialized sensory structures

**Studies finding reduced sensitivity after circumcision:**

A 2013 study using quantitative sensory testing found that circumcision decreases penile sensitivity. Specifically:
- The foreskin has erogenous sensitivity and is more sensitive than uncircumcised glans tissue
- After circumcision, genital sensitivity is lost
- Men who were circumcised reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity
- Higher percentage reported difficulty achieving orgasm
- Higher rates of unusual sensations (burning, prickling, numbness)

**Studies finding no adverse effect:**

A 2016 systematic review of the highest-quality studies concluded that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation, or satisfaction. The review found:
- 40,473 men across high-quality studies
- Uniformly found no overall adverse effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, sexual sensation, erectile function, or orgasm

**Why the contradiction?**

Research quality and study methodology vary dramatically:
- Physiological testing (using instruments to measure sensitivity) shows mixed results
- Self-reported subjective data varies greatly and can be influenced by cultural beliefs, expectations, and attitudes toward circumcision
- Some studies rely on small samples or lower-quality methodology
- Attitude toward one's circumcision status may matter more than actual circumcision status for sexual functioning

The honest answer: the research is mixed, methodologically contested, and not fully settled. Circumcision likely affects tissue sensation (foreskin is sensitive tissue being removed), but whether this translates to reduced sexual satisfaction is less clear and may vary by individual.

### Psychological Effects

The psychological impact of infant circumcision is also contested and under-researched.

**Studies suggesting psychological harm:**

Some research suggests long-term psychological effects:
- One study of 408 men circumcised in infancy and 211 non-circumcised men found that early-circumcised men reported lower attachment security, lower emotional stability, higher perceived stress, and sensation-seeking
- A psychiatry paper describes clinical findings of clients reporting long-term emotional and psychological consequences resembling complex PTSD, including shyness, anger, fear, powerlessness, distrust, low self-esteem, and sexual shame
- A survey of 546 men reporting circumcision harm documented feelings of anger, rage, loss, shame, and feeling victimized or mutilated

**Studies finding no psychological harm:**

A 2022 systematic review examining contrasting evidence on psychological effects found:
- Limited high-quality research
- Mixed findings depending on study design and methodology
- No consensus on whether infant circumcision causes lasting psychological harm
- Cultural context and attitude toward circumcision status may influence perception of harm

**Medical organization positions:**

- Medical societies in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom recognize the potential long-term psychological risks of circumcision
- However, the magnitude of this risk and its prevalence in the circumcised population is not well-established

**The honest answer:** Some men report significant psychological distress related to their infant circumcision; others report no psychological effect. The research is limited, and we don't know how many circumcised men experience psychological harm versus how many are unaffected.

## Part 5: Cultural and Religious Considerations

For many families, circumcision is about culture and religion, not medicine. Understanding these traditions matters.

### Jewish Tradition: Brit Milah

In Jewish tradition, circumcision (brit milah, or "bris") is a central religious practice.

**The timing: Day 8**

Brit milah is performed on the 8th day of a boy's life. This timing has both religious and medical significance.

Jewish law postpones circumcision if the baby is ill or has jaundice, and specifies that if two brothers died from complications of circumcision, the third brother should not be circumcised. This Talmudic guidance is strikingly consistent with concern about hemophilia, an X-linked bleeding disorder.

**The physiological basis for day 8:**

By day 8 of life, an infant's blood clotting ability has naturally increased:
- Vitamin K levels rise naturally after birth and peak around day 8
- Clotting factors (especially prothrombin) reach and exceed normal adult levels
- This natural increase in clotting ability reduces bleeding risk

Dr. Armand James Quick, a specialist in blood research, noted that the amount of blood clotting agents is very small in the first few days of life, but by day 8, prothrombin levels not only reach normal but surpass it, making circumcision safer.

This is remarkable: the ancient Jewish tradition essentially established the optimal timing for blood clotting without modern hematology knowledge.

**Pain management in Jewish tradition:**

Traditional brit milah involves minimal or no pain management. Modern Jewish circumcisers (mohelim) vary in their approach:
- Some use only comfort measures (sweet liquids, swaddling)
- Some use topical anesthetic or local injection
- Pain management approaches are evolving, with some Jewish organizations and mohelim now using anesthesia

### Muslim Tradition: Khitan

In Islam, circumcision (khitan, or "khatna") is practiced widely but is not explicitly mandated in the Quran. It is mentioned in hadith (reports of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings) and is considered important in Islamic practice.

**Timing varies widely:**

Unlike the specific 8th-day timing in Jewish tradition, Islamic timing varies:
- Some families have it done days after birth
- Common timing is around age 6-7 years
- Some families wait until later childhood or even puberty
- Saudi Arabia commonly performs it on day 3 of life
- No consensus exists across Muslim-majority countries or Islamic schools of thought

**The range:** Any time from soon after birth up to age 15, with 6-7 years being common.

**Religious significance:**

Circumcision is seen as symbolizing cleanliness and purification. Most Islamic scholars view it as highly recommended (sunnah) rather than mandatory (wajib), though opinions vary by school of Islamic thought.

### American Cultural Context

In the United States, circumcision became a cultural norm in the 20th century, but for reasons unrelated to religious practice.

**How circumcision became normal in America:**

- In 1900, fewer than 5% of American boys were circumcised
- By 1970, about 80-90% were circumcised
- This shift was driven by medical claims (many later disproven) rather than religious practice
- Medical authorities claimed circumcision prevented masturbation, reduced infection, and improved hygiene
- It became the default newborn procedure

**Current trends—circumcision is declining:**

- U.S. circumcision rate (2020s): approximately 55-60% (down from 80-90% in the 1970s)
- Regional variation is dramatic:
  - Western states: 30-40%
  - Midwest: 60-70%
  - Southern states: 60-70%
  - Northeast: 55-65%
- Demographic variation: Rates are lower among Hispanic and Asian American families
- For families without religious or cultural reasons for circumcision, the trend is toward leaving infants intact

**The shift:** Circumcision is increasingly seen as a cultural choice rather than a medical default.

---

## Part 6: Ethical Considerations

The medical and statistical case for circumcision is limited. But many people approach this decision through an ethical lens, not just a medical one.

### Bodily Autonomy and Parental Rights

The central ethical tension in circumcision is between parental rights and the child's right to bodily integrity.

**The parental authority question:**

Parents have authority to make medical decisions for their children. This authority is grounded in the assumption that parents act in their child's best interests. But this authority isn't unlimited—it extends to necessary medical care and has limits when procedures are not medically necessary.

**The bodily autonomy argument:**

Many ethicists and medical organizations argue that:
- Circumcision is an irreversible, surgical alteration of the genitals of a healthy minor who cannot consent
- The child cannot understand the procedure or participate in the decision
- The procedure is not medically necessary to save the child's life or treat a disease
- Some argue the decision should be deferred until the child is old enough to consent as an adult

**International medical perspectives:**

Several medical organizations have taken positions emphasizing the child's right to bodily integrity:
- Swedish Medical Association: Recommended 12 as minimum age and requiring the child's consent
- Danish Medical Association: Emphasized the child's right to self-determination and bodily integrity
- Canadian Paediatric Society: Highlighted ethical issues surrounding inability to consent
- Royal Australasian College of Physicians: Noted that complication rates and disease frequency don't warrant routine infant circumcision

**German court ruling (2012):**

A German court held that circumcision of a non-consenting boy constitutes criminal assault, even when performed for religious reasons. This ruling sparked international legal and ethical debate.

### Irreversibility

Unlike many medical decisions, circumcision is permanent.

**What can't be undone:**
- The foreskin tissue is removed and cannot be regrown
- Any loss of sensation is permanent
- The altered anatomy is permanent
- Any psychological response to the alteration is permanent

**The "I would choose this myself" standard:**

Some ethicists argue that medical procedures on children should meet a standard: "Would the child likely choose this for themselves as an adult?"

For most medical decisions (vaccinations, ear tubes, broken bone setting), the answer is yes. For circumcision in a non-religious context, the answer is less clear.

**The irreversibility argument:** Because circumcision is permanent and non-therapeutic, some argue it should be deferred until the individual can consent.

### Medical Necessity and Consent

Informed consent doctrine distinguishes between:
- **Therapeutic interventions:** Treating disease or preventing serious harm (can be done without explicit consent if medically necessary)
- **Non-therapeutic interventions:** Not treating disease but potentially offering benefits (require explicit informed consent)

Circumcision is generally considered non-therapeutic in healthy newborns. Therefore, it requires parental informed consent.

**What "informed" means:**
- Understanding the procedure (what it is, how it's done)
- Understanding the risks (complications, pain, loss of tissue)
- Understanding the benefits (what the evidence shows)
- Understanding alternatives (not doing it, doing it later)
- Understanding that there's no medical emergency requiring immediate decision-making

Many parents don't receive this information before being asked to consent.

### Cultural and Religious Exemptions

Different societies approach circumcision ethics differently.

**The rights perspective:**

Some argue that religious and cultural traditions deserve protection, and that families have rights to practice their traditions even when the state might not recommend the procedure universally.

**The children's rights perspective:**

Others argue that children's rights to bodily integrity should supersede parental cultural and religious rights, especially when the procedure is not medically necessary.

**The actual legal landscape:**

- Most developed countries do not ban circumcision for religious reasons (Jewish and Muslim communities continue the practice)
- Some countries have attempted to restrict it (Iceland debated a ban; some European countries have discussed it)
- Most developed countries allow circumcision when parental consent is given, with exceptions for abuse or medical neglect

---

## Part 7: Making the Decision

Whether to circumcise is ultimately your decision. Here are questions to consider and information to guide you.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

**About your values:**
- Is circumcision part of your religious or cultural tradition?
- Do you value continuity with your family/community?
- How important is bodily autonomy to you? Do you think children should have future choice?
- What does your partner think? Are you aligned?

**About the medical evidence:**
- Does the medical evidence for disease prevention matter to you?
- Are you concerned about complications, even if rare?
- Does your family have a history of urological problems or infections?
- Does your family have a history of bleeding disorders?

**About practical considerations:**
- Will you have adequate pain management available?
- Do you have a provider experienced in circumcision?
- Is circumcision standard practice in your healthcare setting?
- What is your access to postoperative care if complications arise?

### If You Choose Circumcision

If you decide to circumcise, these considerations can optimize the experience:

**Timing:**
- Day 8 is considered optimal (aligns with Jewish tradition and allows blood clotting to normalize)
- Earlier (day 1-3) is acceptable but doesn't allow blood clotting to peak
- The newborn period (first week to 2 weeks) is considered safest by most providers
- Waiting past the newborn period is possible but less commonly available and more complicated to perform

**Pain management—ask for it explicitly:**
- Request a local anesthetic
- Dorsal penile nerve block or ring block is most effective
- Topical anesthetic is an alternative if injection is not used
- If your provider doesn't offer anesthesia, ask why and consider another provider
- Even with anesthesia, your newborn will experience some pain; comfort measures (holding, sucrose) matter

**Provider selection:**
- Ask about your provider's experience and complication rate
- If you have a religious circumciser (mohel, etc.), ask about their training and approach to pain management
- Verify the procedure will be performed in a sterile medical environment (even if not in a hospital)
- Ensure adequate equipment and supplies for complications are available

**Postoperative care:**
- Understand the specific aftercare instructions for the method used
- Know when bleeding requires calling a provider
- Know when signs of infection require medical evaluation
- Plan for diaper changes and cleaning according to instructions
- Avoid unnecessary handling or manipulation of the circumcision site

**Medical follow-up:**
- Schedule a follow-up check within a week if not done before discharge
- Watch for ongoing bleeding, increasing redness, or foul-smelling discharge
- Arrange for any postoperative complications to be addressed promptly

### If You Choose Not to Circumcise

If you decide not to circumcise, your child will have an intact penis. Here's what you need to know about care and what to expect.

**Newborn care:**

The care of an uncircumcised newborn penis is straightforward:
- In the first few months, wash with warm water only (no soap, no cotton swabs, no antiseptics)
- The foreskin is fused to the glans and will not retract; this is normal and protective
- Never force the foreskin back
- Clean only what is visible and easy to see
- Diaper changes: regular diaper care is sufficient

**What's normal:**

- The foreskin will not retract in infancy; this is expected and protective
- A white or yellowish substance under the foreskin (smegma) is normal and serves a protective function
- Small pearl-like bumps under the foreskin are normal
- There may be some white discharge; this is normal

**As your child grows (ages 1-5):**

- The foreskin gradually separates from the glans naturally
- This happens at different ages for different boys (can take years)
- Never force retraction
- Your pediatrician will let you know when separation is complete
- Until complete separation, care remains the same: warm water only

**When the foreskin is fully retractable (usually age 3-5+):**

- You can teach your son to gently pull back the foreskin and rinse with warm water during bathtime
- This prevents buildup of smegma and maintains hygiene
- A child as young as 3 can be taught to do this
- This becomes a normal part of hygiene, similar to how girls are taught to wipe after toileting

**When to contact a doctor:**

- If the foreskin cannot retract by the time your son reaches puberty, discuss with your doctor
- If your son has pain, redness, or swelling
- If the foreskin cannot be returned to its normal position (this is rare but requires prompt medical evaluation)

**Important: this is straightforward care:**

Many parents worry about caring for an intact penis, but the care is actually simpler than caring for a circumcised penis (which has a healing wound). "If intact, do not retract. Only clean what is seen." That's essentially it.

**Teaching your son:**

As your son grows, you'll teach him:
- That everyone's body is different (some boys are circumcised, some are not)
- How to keep his penis clean
- How to respect his own body and others' bodies
- Age-appropriate sexual health information

**Phimosis concerns:**

The most common parental concern is "what if he develops phimosis?"

Remember:
- Physiologic phimosis (inability to retract in childhood) is normal, not a problem
- Pathologic phimosis (causing actual symptoms) occurs in only 1-2% of boys
- If it does develop, first-line treatment is topical corticosteroid cream (effective in 75-90% of cases)
- Circumcision is not necessary as a preventive measure

## Part 8: Caring for a Circumcised Penis

If you choose circumcision, understanding proper aftercare prevents complications.

### The Healing Process

**Typical healing timeline:**

- **Days 1-3:** Wound is wet and may ooze
- **Days 3-7:** Wound begins to dry; may become yellowish (this is normal healing tissue)
- **Days 7-10:** Wound dries further
- **Days 10-14:** Most healing is complete; slight redness may persist
- **Weeks 2-4:** Continued healing; any remaining redness fades
- **Month 1-2:** Full healing and epithelialization complete

**After Plastibell (if used):**
- The plastic ring stays on for about 5-8 days
- It will fall off as tissue underneath dies and separates
- A small amount of bleeding when it falls off is normal

### Wound Care

Follow your provider's specific instructions, but general care typically includes:

**For diaper changes:**
- Change diapers frequently to keep the area clean and dry
- Gently clean with warm water (some providers recommend warm water with saline)
- Pat dry with a clean cloth
- Apply any prescribed ointment (antibiotic ointment or other)
- Use diaper-free time (have baby without diaper) to promote air circulation when possible

**Avoiding irritation:**
- Avoid friction from diapers; secure loosely or use a larger size
- Avoid plastic pants that don't allow air circulation
- Don't use wipes with alcohol or fragrance (plain warm water is best)
- Avoid tight clothing

### When to Contact a Doctor

**Warning signs requiring prompt evaluation:**

- **Excessive bleeding** that doesn't stop with gentle pressure after 10 minutes
- **Signs of infection:** increasing redness, warmth, pus, foul-smelling discharge, fever
- **Swelling or redness that worsens** after day 3
- **Wound won't heal** or opens after initially healed
- **Inability to urinate** or unusual urinary symptoms
- **Any sign of meatal stenosis:** difficulty urinating, weak stream, or spraying

**Minor concerns that don't require emergency evaluation but should be discussed:**

- Mild bleeding with diaper change (common in first week)
- Yellowish crust formation (normal)
- Mild swelling in first few days
- Small amounts of clear fluid

## Part 9: Key Takeaways and Final Thoughts

### What the Evidence Actually Shows

1. **Benefits are real but limited:**
   - UTI reduction is the most solid benefit (but 100+ boys need circumcision to prevent one UTI)
   - Other benefits (HIV prevention, penile cancer prevention) are either limited to specific contexts or prevent extremely rare conditions
   - The AAP concluded benefits outweigh risks, but not enough to recommend universally

2. **Risks are usually minor but real:**
   - Complication rate is 1.5-3% in experienced hands
   - Serious complications are rare but documented
   - Pain during procedure is significant and not always adequately managed
   - Permanent loss of tissue is certain

3. **International consensus is skeptical:**
   - European, Australian, and other developed-country medical organizations oppose routine circumcision
   - The U.S. is unusual in its acceptance of routine circumcision

4. **It's not a medical emergency:**
   - The decision can be made thoughtfully; there's no time pressure
   - Phimosis is rare and treatable without circumcision
   - Most newborns don't need this procedure

### A Framework for Decision-Making

**Step 1: Gather information** (which you're doing)

**Step 2: Clarify your values**
- What matters to you? Medical evidence? Cultural continuity? Bodily autonomy? Community practice?
- Is this decision aligned with your partner?

**Step 3: Consider your specific situation**
- Do you have family history of bleeding disorders or UTI?
- Is circumcision part of your religious tradition?
- What is the practice in your healthcare setting?
- What support and resources are available to you?

**Step 4: Make a decision**
- Informed by evidence
- Aligned with your values
- Appropriate to your circumstances

**Step 5: If you decide to circumcise, optimize the experience**
- Ensure adequate pain management
- Choose an experienced provider
- Plan appropriate aftercare

**Step 6: If you decide not to circumcise, plan appropriate care**
- Understand simple care of intact penis
- Know normal development
- Know when medical evaluation is needed

### The Bottom Line

Circumcision is a choice, not a medical necessity for most newborn boys. The evidence supports either decision:
- If you circumcise, your son's risk of certain infections is reduced, but he experiences immediate pain and permanent alteration of his anatomy
- If you don't circumcise, your son has an intact penis and straightforward care; disease risks are slightly higher but easily managed

This is a decision that should be:
- **Informed** — You understand the evidence, the options, and the trade-offs
- **Thoughtful** — You've considered your values and your specific situation
- **Supported** — You have a provider who can help you execute whichever choice you make safely

There's no single "right" answer. There's only the right answer for your family.
