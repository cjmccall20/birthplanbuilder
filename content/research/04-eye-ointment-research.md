# Eye Ointment (Erythromycin) for Newborns: A Comprehensive Guide

Understanding what eye ointment is, why it's given, and whether your baby needs it.

---

## Introduction: The Eye Ointment Decision

In the first moments after birth, while you're hoping to gaze into your baby's eyes, a nurse applies antibiotic ointment to both of your newborn's eyes. In most U.S. states, this is not optional—it's the law.

This practice, mandated for over 100 years in most states, has roots in genuine tragedy. In the late 1800s, gonorrhea caused blindness in roughly 3% of newborns born in hospitals. One doctor's innovation with silver nitrate drops changed that history. Today, that innovation has become routine—but the disease it was designed to prevent is now rare, especially among women who receive prenatal care.

This guide examines what eye ointment actually does, what problems it's meant to prevent, who truly needs it, and what your options are. Like birth setting or pain management, this is a decision where understanding the evidence matters.

## Part 1: What Is Erythromycin Eye Ointment?

### The Medication

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic ointment applied directly to a newborn's eyes immediately after birth. The standard dose is 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment—a thin line applied to each lower eyelid, then the eyelids are massaged gently to spread the medication across the eye's surface.

The medication remains the only FDA-approved prophylactic agent currently available in the United States for newborn eye prophylaxis.

### How It's Administered

Standard administration follows this protocol:

- A line of ointment "sufficiently long to cover the entire lower conjunctival area" is placed in each lower eyelid
- The eyelid is protected from the ointment applicator tip to prevent injury
- The eyelids are massaged gently to distribute the ointment
- After 1 minute, excess ointment is wiped away with sterile cotton

The entire procedure takes just minutes. Ideally, the ointment is applied within 1 hour of birth, though it can be effective up to 24 hours after delivery.

### What It Looks Like

Many parents describe a slight grittiness when watching their newborn after ointment application. The baby's eyes may be harder to see clearly for 15-30 minutes while the ointment is present. Some parents note temporary blurring or mild irritation in the infant's eyes.

---

## Part 2: What Problem Does It Prevent?

### Ophthalmia Neonatorum: The Original Problem

Ophthalmia neonatorum, also called neonatal conjunctivitis, is an eye infection occurring in the first four weeks of life. The infection causes inflammation of the conjunctiva—the thin membrane covering the inner eyelid and white of the eye.

Before modern antibiotics and prenatal screening, this condition was devastating.

### Historical Context: Why This Law Exists

In the 1880s, about 10% of newborns born in European hospital maternity wards developed ophthalmia neonatorum. Of those infected, approximately 3% went blind. Without treatment, 30-50% of infected infants developed corneal ulceration, eye perforation, and permanent blindness. Gonorrhea was responsible for roughly one quarter of all cases of blindness worldwide at the time.

This was childhood tragedy at scale.

### Carl Credé's Innovation (1880)

In 1880, a German obstetrician named Carl Siegmund Franz Credé introduced a procedure using 2% silver nitrate drops applied immediately after birth. The results were dramatic: the incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia dropped from 10% to 0.3% of newborns.

Credé's innovation became one of the great triumphs of preventive medicine in the preantibiotic era. He campaigned tirelessly for widespread adoption, training midwives and ensuring that even home birth babies received the prophylaxis. By the early 1900s, his method had spread worldwide and was mandated by law in most countries, including all 50 U.S. states.

However, silver nitrate had a problem: it caused chemical conjunctivitis (inflammation) in 50-90% of treated infants, causing temporary eye irritation and blurred vision.

### The Shift to Erythromycin

By the 1950s, erythromycin replaced silver nitrate as the standard prophylactic agent. It was more effective against gonorrhea, effective against some cases of chlamydia, and caused fewer side effects. Silver nitrate is no longer available or used in the United States.

### What Infections Does Erythromycin Prevent?

**Gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae):**
Erythromycin is approximately 80% effective at preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. For newborns born to mothers with untreated gonorrhea, the transmission risk is high: between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 infected infants will develop gonococcal eye infection. If left untreated, gonococcal infection can cause permanent blindness—with vision loss beginning within 24 hours of birth.

**Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis):**
Erythromycin does not effectively prevent chlamydial conjunctivitis. Research shows that erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is ineffective at preventing chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum. While one older study (1980) suggested some benefit, current population data indicate erythromycin provides little to no protection against chlamydial eye infection. However, oral erythromycin given to exposed newborns may reduce the risk of chlamydial pneumonia (a more serious respiratory infection).

**Other bacteria:**
One study found that erythromycin may offer some protection against eye infection from Staphylococcus bacteria, though this is not the primary purpose of the medication.

### Current Transmission Rates

In the modern U.S., transmission rates are dramatically different from the 1880s because of two factors: prenatal screening and treatment.

**Gonorrhea transmission risk:**
Among mothers with untreated gonorrhea who deliver vaginally, transmission to the newborn occurs in approximately 30-50% of cases. However, in the United States, most pregnant women are screened for gonorrhea during prenatal care. Among women who test negative—which includes the vast majority of pregnant people receiving prenatal care—the transmission risk is essentially zero.

**Chlamydia transmission risk:**
Similar to gonorrhea, chlamydia transmission occurs in roughly 30-50% of vaginal deliveries to infected mothers. Again, prenatal screening and treatment reduce this risk dramatically.

**Incidence of ophthalmia neonatorum in the modern U.S.:**
Cases of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum are now uncommon in the United States, largely due to gonorrhea screening programs for pregnant women. The disease is rare enough that many pediatricians in practice today may never see a case.

---

## Part 3: The Case Against Mandatory Prophylaxis

### Most Mothers Are Tested and Treated

The fundamental problem with universal prophylaxis in 2024 is this: it treats a risk that no longer exists for most pregnant people.

**CDC guidelines for prenatal STI screening:**
All pregnant women should be tested for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B at their first prenatal visit. Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea is recommended for all pregnant women under age 25 and for older women with risk factors. This means most pregnant people in the U.S. healthcare system are screened.

**Current screening rates:**
In a nationally representative U.S. study, approximately 48% of recently pregnant patients reported being screened for chlamydia, and 54% reported being screened for other STIs. A study of 2,370 pregnant patients found that 76.6% received adherent initial STI screening.

While these rates are not perfect, they represent substantial coverage. Among women with prenatal care, the rates are higher—most women receiving standard prenatal care are screened.

**Treatment availability:**
If screening reveals infection, treatment is straightforward and highly effective. Gonorrhea is treated with ceftriaxone. Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics like azithromycin or doxycycline. These treatments are inexpensive, widely available, and effective at preventing neonatal transmission.

### What This Means

For the pregnant person who has received prenatal care, tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and is in a monogamous relationship—the infection risk is essentially zero. Universal eye prophylaxis in this scenario is treating a risk that doesn't exist.

### AAP 2024 Position: Time to Reconsider

In 2024, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) took a significant stance: they called for "ongoing re-evaluation of the medical necessity of legislative mandates in the United States for universal neonatal eye prophylaxis."

This language is careful but significant. The AAP is not saying the ointment is harmful. They're saying that mandatory, universal application to all newborns—regardless of maternal risk—is worth questioning.

Their 2024 recommendation states: "If gonorrhea infection is prevalent in the region and prenatal treatment cannot be ensured, or where required by law, 0.5% erythromycin ointment should be instilled into the eyes of newborn infants." Notice the conditions: prevalence in the region, inability to ensure treatment, or legal requirement. Not universal application by default.

### The International Shift

Several developed nations have already moved away from mandatory universal prophylaxis.

**Countries that no longer require routine prophylaxis:**
- United Kingdom
- Denmark
- Norway
- Sweden
- Canada (except in some provinces)

These countries, with healthcare systems comparable to or exceeding the U.S., have concluded that prenatal screening and treatment is sufficient. Rather than treating all newborns, they screen and treat pregnant women—eliminating the need for prophylaxis in most cases.

**Countries maintaining universal prophylaxis:**
- France
- Italy
- Spain
- Brazil
- Turkey
- Slovenia
- Austria

The divide is interesting: it roughly correlates with the robustness of prenatal screening infrastructure. Countries confident in their prenatal screening systems have moved toward selective prophylaxis or none. Countries with less robust systems maintain universal prophylaxis.

### The Canadian Change

Canada's position is particularly instructive. The Canadian Paediatric Society stated in 2015 (reaffirmed in 2018):

"Neonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent currently available in Canada for this purpose, may no longer be useful and, therefore, should not be routinely recommended."

Their reasoning: erythromycin's effectiveness against gonorrhea is declining due to resistance (discussed below), it doesn't prevent chlamydia, and prenatal screening combined with treatment is a more effective strategy. They further recommended that "Physicians caring for newborns should advocate for rescinding mandatory ocular prophylaxis laws."

This is a remarkable position from a major professional organization—calling for the elimination of a legal mandate based on evidence.

## Part 4: Growing Resistance and Effectiveness Concerns

### Gonorrhea Resistance to Erythromycin

One of the strongest arguments for reconsideration is emerging antibiotic resistance.

**Resistance rates:**
- Canada (2012): 23% of gonorrhea strains showed resistance to erythromycin
- Multiple countries: Resistance rates of 32.4% have been reported
- Global pattern: N. gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to most antibiotics used to treat it in adults

The bacterium causing gonorrhea is becoming resistant to erythromycin. This raises a crucial question: if erythromycin's effectiveness is declining, is universal prophylaxis becoming less effective?

While research specific to eye ointment efficacy in the modern era is limited, the resistance data is concerning. The studies showing erythromycin's 80% effectiveness were conducted decades ago, before widespread resistance emerged.

### Chlamydia Resistance

Antibiotic resistance in chlamydia is currently rare, and clinical strains resistant to erythromycin have not yet emerged. However, erythromycin-resistant strains have been created in laboratory settings, suggesting potential for future resistance.

### Alternative Agents

Silver nitrate drops (historically effective against gonorrhea but no longer available in the U.S.) are being revisited by some researchers. More promising is **povidone-iodine solution** (1.25-2.5%), which:
- Is just as effective as erythromycin at preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum
- Does not increase antibiotic resistance
- Works as a disinfectant rather than through antibiotic mechanisms
- Is available and inexpensive

During the erythromycin shortage that occurred in 2024, the AAP recommended that if erythromycin was unavailable and a newborn was at risk, either a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of the mother could be performed at delivery, or if the mother was positive or high-risk, the newborn could receive ceftriaxone (an antibiotic injection) instead of eye ointment.

---

## Part 5: Effects on Your Newborn

### Temporary Vision Blurring

Erythromycin causes temporary blurred or cloudy vision in the treated eye. This effect typically lasts 15-30 minutes while the ointment is present and active.

For parents hoping for those first clear eye-to-eye moments with their newborn, this matters. Many describe the experience of their baby's unfocused gaze immediately after birth as deeply meaningful. The ointment does interfere with that clarity.

### Chemical Irritation ("Chemical Pink Eye")

In studies, approximately 13% of newborns who received erythromycin developed mild chemical conjunctivitis—inflammation and irritation of the eye—with no underlying infection. The eye appears red or slightly swollen, but cultures show no bacteria.

This is generally mild and self-limiting but is a real side effect. For parents, it can be confusing: your baby's eyes look infected even though they're not.

### Impact on Bonding: The Research and The Nuance

The bonding concern is real but also somewhat speculative.

Research shows that from birth, newborns can distinguish between direct and indirect eye contact and prefer mutual gazing with their parents. The "golden hour"—the first 60 minutes after birth—is established as important for early bonding, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding initiation.

The question is whether temporary blurred vision from eye ointment meaningfully interferes with this bonding.

**What experts say:**
Some experts suspect that blurred vision "could potentially interfere with bonding by disrupting early eye gazing between the newborn and parents." This is a reasonable hypothesis, but it's not definitively proven. Bonding involves multiple factors—holding, skin-to-skin contact, voice recognition, smell—not just clear vision in the first 30 minutes.

The 2019 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the "net benefit of ocular prophylaxis continues to be well established" and found "convincing evidence that ocular prophylaxis of newborns with 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is not associated with serious harms."

This statement suggests that bonding disruption, if it occurs, is not considered a serious harm by this major evidence body.

**The practical reality:**
Many hospitals have begun delaying prophylaxis until after the "golden hour" is complete. The AAP recommends that routine procedures including eye prophylaxis can be delayed until the first feeding is completed or at least one hour after delivery. This allows parents and baby their bonding time while ensuring the medication is still applied within the effective window.

Some hospitals now apply the ointment while mother and baby are skin-to-skin or breastfeeding, allowing medical care to proceed without interrupting bonding.

### Safety Profile Overall

Research concludes that erythromycin eye ointment is generally safe. Serious adverse effects are rare. The main side effects are temporary (blurred vision) or mild (chemical irritation).

## Part 6: When Erythromycin Eye Ointment Makes Sense

Eye ointment is genuinely important for certain mothers and babies. Understanding when it's indicated helps clarify the universal vs. selective debate.

### Clear Indications for Eye Prophylaxis

**Untreated or unknown maternal gonorrhea or chlamydia infection:**
If a mother has tested positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia and either cannot be treated before delivery or has not been treated, eye prophylaxis for the newborn is medically appropriate. Even better is treatment of the mother before birth, which prevents transmission entirely—but if that doesn't happen, prophylaxis is important.

**Unknown maternal STI status:**
If a pregnant person received little or no prenatal care and maternal STI status is unknown at delivery, eye prophylaxis is reasonable. This includes homeless, unhoused, or severely marginalized pregnant people who may not have had access to prenatal screening. It also includes people who deliver unexpectedly at home or in a setting where maternal testing cannot be performed.

**High-risk indicators:**
Even without confirmed infection, certain risk factors may warrant prophylaxis:
- Age under 25 (higher statistical risk of STI)
- Multiple sexual partners
- History of prior STI
- No prenatal care
- Symptoms suggestive of STI at delivery (unusual discharge, burning, pain)
- Partner with known STI

**Cesarean delivery considerations:**
Interestingly, while the standard recommendation is for eye prophylaxis regardless of delivery mode, the risk for gonorrheal transmission during planned cesarean delivery is essentially eliminated. The infant doesn't pass through the birth canal. However, some guidelines still recommend prophylaxis for "just in case" scenarios (e.g., unplanned rupture of membranes before the cesarean). This is where individualized decision-making matters.

### The Core Question: Who Actually Needs This?

If you have:
- Received routine prenatal care
- Been screened for STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, syphilis)
- Tested negative for all STI screening
- Are in a monogamous relationship with a tested partner

Then the infection risk is essentially zero, and eye prophylaxis is prevention of a risk that doesn't exist for you.

---

## Part 7: When You Might Decline Eye Ointment

### Medical Reasoning for Selective Use

A growing number of evidence-based practitioners support this framework:

1. **Screen all pregnant women** for gonorrhea and chlamydia
2. **Treat any positive cases** during pregnancy
3. **Test unscreened mothers** at the time of delivery (via rapid test if available)
4. **Offer prophylaxis** to newborns whose mothers are positive or untested
5. **Counsel parents** on monitoring for eye infection symptoms and seeking immediate care if they develop

This approach is used successfully in several developed nations and reflects the 2024 AAP position.

### How Risk Assessment Works

To determine whether eye ointment is appropriate for your situation, ask yourself:

**Have you received prenatal care?**
If yes, proceed. If no, eye ointment is reasonable.

**Were you screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia?**
If yes and negative, proceed. If positive or untested, eye ointment is indicated.

**Are you in a mutually monogamous relationship with a tested partner?**
If yes, proceed. If no or uncertain, eye ointment provides additional safety.

**Do you have any risk factors for STI?**
(Age under 25, history of STI, symptoms, partner with known infection)
If yes, eye ointment is safer. If no, your risk is lower.

If you answered "yes" to prenatal care, "negative" to STI screening, and have no major risk factors, your risk for transmitting gonorrhea or chlamydia to your newborn is extremely low.

### What Safety Precautions Replace Prophylaxis?

If you decline eye ointment based on low risk, what replaces it?

**Maternal vigilance:**
Understanding that eye symptoms in a newborn can be serious. Red, swollen, or draining eyes in the first weeks of life warrant immediate medical attention.

**Rapid access to care:**
Having a plan for urgent evaluation if your newborn develops eye symptoms. This includes knowing how to contact your pediatrician or how to access emergency care.

**Clear communication:**
Ensuring your pediatrician knows you declined prophylaxis and should monitor accordingly.

**Honesty about risk:**
If you have any actual risk factors (new partner, untreated STI, or unknown status), prophylaxis is genuinely safer.

## Part 8: The Legal Landscape

### State Mandates: The Current Reality

Nearly all U.S. states mandate newborn eye prophylaxis by law. In 2006, at least 32 states had statutes or regulations requiring prophylaxis. That number likely remains similar today.

**Standard requirements:**
- The medication must be administered within 1-2 hours of birth
- Failure to administer is typically a misdemeanor
- Some states impose penalties on both the healthcare provider and, rarely, parents

**Where to find your state's law:**
Your state's health department website typically provides guidance on newborn prophylaxis requirements. The specific legal code varies by state. Some states specify exactly which medication must be used; others allow alternatives.

### Recent Legislative Changes (2024-2025)

The landscape is beginning to shift.

**West Virginia (2025):**
In July 2025, West Virginia repealed a more than 100-year-old mandate for newborn eye prophylaxis. The law went into effect without the governor's signature (meaning it passed with veto-proof support). This marks the first state to fully eliminate the requirement in recent years.

**Idaho (2025):**
Idaho enacted a law that modifies the state's mandate, including changing terminology from "germicide" to "ocular antibiotic prophylaxis," suggesting a softening of the universal requirement language.

**Tennessee:**
Tennessee has made changes to allow parents to decline prophylaxis in certain circumstances.

These changes, while incremental, suggest increasing recognition that mandatory universal prophylaxis may be outdated given modern prenatal screening capabilities.

### Parental Rights: Can You Refuse?

This varies dramatically by state. Know your state's law before birth if this is important to you.

**States that allow informed refusal:**
Some states permit parents to decline eye prophylaxis after being informed of the risks and benefits. This typically requires signing a waiver or informed refusal form. Examples include:
- California (requires written refusal)
- Tennessee
- West Virginia

**States with strict liability:**
In some states, refusing is not a legal option for parents, and providers face criminal liability for non-administration. In Texas, for example, even if parents sign a waiver refusing the ointment, the healthcare provider can face criminal charges (it's a misdemeanor for a provider NOT to administer the ointment).

**States with no clear opt-out:**
New York, for example, provides no explicit mechanism for parents to refuse eye prophylaxis. Healthcare providers are required to administer it.

**What this means for you:**
Before birth, research your state's specific law. Contact your hospital or birthing center and ask directly: "What is your policy on parental refusal of eye prophylaxis?" If you're planning home birth, ask your midwife.

### The Informed Consent Issue

A core tension exists between legal mandate and informed consent. Informed consent requires that you:
1. Understand the procedure
2. Understand the risks and benefits
3. Understand alternatives
4. Make a voluntary choice

A legal mandate, by definition, limits voluntariness. You can't make a truly voluntary choice if the law doesn't permit saying no.

Some states have tried to balance this by requiring informed consent documentation—meaning you sign a form confirming you were informed of the purpose of the medication—whether you accept or refuse it. This is more protective of your right to participate in decisions about your care.

### What You Can Do

**Before pregnancy:**
Research your state's law. If the law troubles you and you have flexibility in where you give birth, this might influence where you choose to deliver.

**During pregnancy:**
Include eye ointment in your birth plan discussion with your healthcare team. Ask about your specific state's legal requirements and your options within those constraints.

**In writing:**
If your state allows refusal, getting refusal language in writing before labor is clearer than trying to negotiate in the moment.

**Partner/advocate communication:**
If you plan to decline, ensure your birth partner understands this is your preference and can communicate it if you're unable to do so during labor.

## Part 9: The Erythromycin Shortage and What It Means

### 2024 Shortage

In January 2024, the United States experienced a significant shortage of erythromycin ophthalmic ointment. Multiple manufacturers experienced supply disruptions, creating a crisis for hospitals and birthing centers that rely on the medication.

### AAP Guidance During Shortage

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidance for managing the shortage:

If erythromycin ointment is unavailable and a birthing parent is at risk for gonorrhea:
1. The pregnant person can be tested using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at delivery
2. If the test is positive or results are pending at discharge, the newborn receives ceftriaxone (an injection): 25-50 mg/kg body weight, IV or IM, not to exceed 250 mg

### What This Reveals

The shortage inadvertently highlighted something significant: alternative approaches can work. Hospitals that lacked erythromycin didn't suddenly see epidemic levels of neonatal ophthalmia. Instead, they:
- Tested mothers
- Treated positive cases
- Treated exposed newborns if necessary

The fact that this alternative approach was feasible and acceptable suggests that the system could move toward risk-based selective prophylaxis if policy changed.

---

## Part 10: Alternatives and Evolving Approaches

### Primary Prevention: Prenatal Screening and Treatment

The most effective strategy for preventing ophthalmia neonatorum is preventing maternal infection in the first place—through screening and treatment during pregnancy.

**Effectiveness:**
Prenatal screening and treatment eliminates the infection risk entirely. A mother without gonorrhea or chlamydia cannot transmit these to her newborn.

**Current practice:**
This is standard of care in most U.S. healthcare settings. The issue is not whether the mechanism works, but whether it's applied universally—particularly among uninsured, homeless, or marginalized pregnant people who may not access prenatal care.

### Povidone-Iodine Solution

Povidone-iodine (a disinfectant solution) in strengths of 1.25-2.5% is an alternative prophylactic agent.

**Effectiveness:**
Research shows povidone-iodine is just as effective as erythromycin and silver nitrate at preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.

**Advantages:**
- Does not promote antibiotic resistance
- Inexpensive
- Works through disinfectant action rather than antibiotic mechanism
- Widely available

**Disadvantages:**
- Not approved by the FDA specifically for this purpose in the U.S. (though used internationally)
- May cause mild irritation
- Requires different administration than ointment

Povidone-iodine is used in several countries but is not currently standard in the U.S., partly due to FDA approval constraints and partly due to inertia around the erythromycin standard.

### Delayed Administration

A practical compromise used in some hospitals is delayed administration of eye ointment.

Rather than applying ointment in the first minutes after birth, the procedure can be delayed until:
- The first feeding is complete
- At least one hour after delivery
- Mother and baby have had bonding time

**Effectiveness:**
Delaying prophylaxis beyond 4 hours can reduce effectiveness (increasing risk of gonococcal infection by 4-5 fold). However, delaying by 1-2 hours maintains good effectiveness while allowing bonding and breastfeeding.

**Current recommendation:**
The AAP states that eye prophylaxis can be delayed until the first feed is completed or at least one hour after delivery, providing flexibility while maintaining efficacy.

### Risk-Based Selective Prophylaxis

The framework proposed by several organizations (AAP 2024, Canadian Pediatric Society, UK guidelines) involves:

1. Universal prenatal screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia
2. Treatment of positive cases during pregnancy
3. Rapid testing of unscreened mothers at delivery
4. Eye prophylaxis offered selectively to newborns of positive or untested mothers
5. No prophylaxis for newborns of screened-negative mothers

This approach:
- Prevents infection equally well for those at risk
- Eliminates unnecessary treatment for those without risk
- Maintains focus on the true prevention (treating maternal infection)
- Reduces unnecessary medication exposure

### What This Means for Future Practice

The trend in developed countries with robust healthcare systems is moving toward risk-based, selective prophylaxis or abandonment of universal prophylaxis altogether. As maternal STI screening becomes more universal (though it's not yet uniform in the U.S.), pressure for policy change will likely increase.

---

## Part 11: Making Your Decision: A Framework

### Step 1: Understand Your Personal Risk

**Questions to assess your risk:**

1. Have you had prenatal care including STI screening?
2. Were you tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia during pregnancy?
3. Were your test results negative?
4. Are you in a monogamous relationship?
5. Has your partner been tested for STIs?
6. Do you have any risk factors (age under 25, new partner, prior STI, symptoms)?

If you answered "yes" to questions 1-3 and "yes" to question 4, your infection risk is very low.

If you answered "yes" to question 6, your risk is higher, and prophylaxis is more protective.

### Step 2: Know Your State Law

Contact your state health department or hospital to confirm:
- Is eye prophylaxis mandatory?
- Within what timeframe must it be administered?
- Can parents refuse?
- Is a waiver required?
- Are there any exemptions?

### Step 3: Discuss With Your Healthcare Provider

Include this in your birth preferences discussion:
- "What is our hospital's standard timing for eye prophylaxis?"
- "Can we delay it until after the golden hour?"
- "What happens if I request to decline?"
- "Is a waiver process available?"
- "Has my test result been communicated to the delivery team?"

### Step 4: Decide Based on Your Values and Risk

**Choose prophylaxis if:**
- You have any actual infection risk (untreated STI, unknown status, risk factors)
- You prefer not to worry about the small remaining risk
- You want the reassurance of following current legal requirements exactly

**Consider declining if:**
- You have received prenatal care and tested negative
- You are in a known monogamous relationship with a tested partner
- You prioritize unmedicated bonding time in the first hour
- You understand and accept the minimal remaining risk
- Your state law permits refusal

**Choose delayed administration if:**
- You want prophylaxis but prefer to delay it to after bonding time
- This option is available at your birth location
- You understand it remains effective if given within the first few hours

### Step 5: Put It in Your Birth Plan

If you have preferences about eye ointment, include them:

"Our preference regarding newborn eye prophylaxis:
- [ ] Administer as routine within first hour
- [ ] Administer after golden hour/first feeding
- [ ] Decline due to low infection risk (state law allows)
- [ ] Administer while skin-to-skin/breastfeeding"

Ensure a copy goes to your hospital or birthing center.

## Part 12: What Every Parent Should Know

### The Reality of Modern Ophthalmia Neonatorum

Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum in the United States is genuinely rare today. Many practicing pediatricians have never seen a case. This is success—the result of prenatal screening, treatment, and prophylaxis policies.

However, that success shouldn't be taken for granted. For mothers without prenatal care (who remain a vulnerable population), untreated STI risk persists.

### The Tension: Universal Policy vs. Individualized Risk

The current U.S. system uses universal prophylaxis for all newborns. This is a one-size-fits-all approach based on legal mandate rather than individual risk assessment.

For low-risk pregnancies, this means treating a risk that doesn't exist. For high-risk pregnancies with poor prenatal care access, it ensures protection.

For a healthcare system with universal prenatal screening (like the UK or Canada), selective prophylaxis works. For a system with fragmented screening (like the U.S., where coverage varies by insurance, geography, and access), universal prophylaxis is a safety net.

### The Hierarchy of Prevention

Think of ophthalmia neonatorum prevention in tiers:

**Tier 1 (Best): Prevent maternal infection**
Screening, treatment, and prevention of STIs during pregnancy. This eliminates the disease entirely.

**Tier 2 (Good): Treat maternal infection before birth**
If infection occurs, treat it during pregnancy. This prevents transmission to the newborn.

**Tier 3 (Adequate): Treat maternal infection at delivery**
If a mother hasn't been treated, test at delivery and treat immediately, reducing newborn transmission risk.

**Tier 4 (Last resort): Prophylaxis**
Apply medication to newborn's eyes to prevent infection even if maternal transmission wasn't prevented.

The U.S. currently defaults to Tier 4 (prophylaxis) for all babies. More advanced systems focus on Tiers 1-3, using prophylaxis selectively as a safety net.

### Questions for Your Medical Team

- "Can my STI test results be documented in my delivery record so the team knows my status?"
- "What's your hospital's actual rate of ophthalmia neonatorum in recent years?"
- "If I decline eye ointment, how will my baby be monitored?"
- "Who will I contact if I notice eye symptoms after discharge?"
- "What would lead you to give prophylaxis even if I initially declined?"

---

## Part 13: Special Situations

### Home Birth

If you're planning home birth, ask your midwife:

- "What is your protocol for eye prophylaxis?"
- "Do you carry erythromycin?"
- "What is your approach if I want to decline?"
- "Are you familiar with my state's legal requirements?"
- "How would you proceed if my status was unknown at delivery?"

Most home birth midwives are very aware of legal requirements and will plan accordingly. This is good to discuss in advance.

### Birth Center Birth

Birth centers, especially accredited ones, have established protocols. Ask:
- "What is your standard timing for prophylaxis?"
- "Can families request delay for bonding?"
- "What happens if someone wants to decline?"

Many birth centers offer flexibility around timing while ensuring legal compliance.

### Cesarean Delivery

If you're planning a planned cesarean for a low-risk pregnancy, the eye ointment issue becomes even more academic, since the infant won't pass through the birth canal. You might ask:

- "Are you administering eye prophylaxis for all cesareans, or only those with risk factors?"
- "Can we skip it for a planned cesarean with negative maternal testing?"

Some hospitals administer it to everyone; others limit it to those with actual risk.

### Late Prenatal Care

If you haven't had prenatal care until late in pregnancy:
- Get STI screening immediately
- If you test positive, treatment is straightforward and effective
- If you test negative, you have that reassurance for delivery
- If it's very late and testing isn't possible, eye ointment becomes more reasonable as a safety measure

### Unknown Partner Status

If you don't know your partner's STI status or you're not in a monogamous relationship:
- Request an STI test for yourself if you haven't had one
- Honestly discuss this with your medical team
- Eye ointment is a reasonable precaution in this scenario

---

## Part 14: The Bigger Picture

### Why This Decision Matters

Eye ointment is a small procedure with a big history. Understanding it reveals how medical practice changes—or doesn't change—in response to new evidence.

We have a 145-year-old law mandating a procedure designed to prevent a disease that prenatal screening and treatment have made rare. We have professional organizations calling for reconsideration of that law based on modern evidence. Yet the law persists in most states, and most hospitals maintain universal practice despite changing recommendations.

This happens because:
1. Legal momentum: Once something is mandated by law, changing it requires active legislative effort
2. Conservative medical practice: "We've always done it this way" is a powerful force
3. Liability concerns: Providers worry that deviating from standard practice, even if evidence-supported, could expose them to legal risk
4. Incomplete information: Many parents don't know they have options

The eye ointment decision gives you a window into how birth decision-making actually works in the U.S. You have evidence supporting selective application, changing professional recommendations, and legal requirements that don't align with evidence. Navigating this requires research, communication, and clarity about what matters to you.

### What the Research Trends Suggest

If current trends continue:
- More states may follow West Virginia's lead and repeal mandatory requirements
- Professional organizations will likely continue calling for risk-based approaches
- Maternal STI screening rates may improve, making universal prophylaxis even less necessary
- Alternative agents like povidone-iodine may eventually become standard, reducing antibiotic resistance concerns

This is not to say universal prophylaxis will disappear. Some level of newborn eye prophylaxis—either universal or targeted—will remain standard practice for the foreseeable future.

### The Fundamental Issue: Autonomy and Informed Consent

At its core, the eye ointment debate is about autonomy. Should a low-risk parent be required by law to give their newborn medication to prevent a disease that prenatal screening indicates their baby won't encounter? Or should the decision be informed and voluntary?

Different people answer this differently. Some prefer the safety of universal treatment. Others prefer individualized decision-making. Both perspectives have merit.

What's clear is that you deserve complete information to make a choice that aligns with your values, and that choice should be honored within legal bounds.

## Part 15: Summary and Key Takeaways

### What Eye Ointment Is

- Erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment applied to newborn's eyes within the first hours after birth
- Standard practice in most U.S. hospitals, mandated by law in most states
- Designed to prevent bacterial eye infections (ophthalmia neonatorum) from gonorrhea and chlamydia

### Why It Exists

- Originally introduced as silver nitrate drops by Dr. Carl Credé in 1880 to prevent gonorrhea-related blindness
- At that time, ~10% of newborns in hospitals developed the infection, causing blindness in 3%
- Revolutionary intervention that prevented millions of cases of blindness
- Became legally mandated over 100+ years ago; now erythromycin ointment is the standard

### What It Actually Prevents

- Gonorrhea transmission: 80% effective at preventing gonococcal eye infection
- Chlamydia transmission: Largely ineffective at preventing chlamydial eye infection
- Protects against a risk that no longer exists for most U.S. pregnancies due to prenatal screening

### The Modern Problem

- Most U.S. pregnant people receive prenatal care and STI screening
- If negative and low-risk, infection transmission risk is essentially zero
- Universal prophylaxis treats all newborns regardless of individual risk
- Several developed nations have eliminated mandatory universal prophylaxis
- AAP 2024 calls for "ongoing re-evaluation" of mandatory requirements

### Effects on Your Baby

- Temporary blurred vision (15-30 minutes while ointment is present)
- Mild chemical irritation in ~13% of cases (resolves quickly)
- Potential minor interference with early eye contact/bonding during golden hour
- Overall safety profile is good; serious side effects are rare

### When It Actually Matters

Eye ointment is genuinely important for:
- Newborns whose mothers have untreated gonorrhea or chlamydia
- Babies whose mothers were not screened or tested positive
- Situations with unknown maternal STI status
- High-risk pregnancies where alternatives weren't possible

### The Key Variables

- Your prenatal care and STI screening status (most important)
- Your state's legal requirements (determines whether you can decline)
- Your values (bonding vs. infection prevention)
- Your actual infection risk (low vs. elevated)

### Your Options

1. **Accept it**: Standard practice, legally compliant, ensures maximum protection
2. **Decline it**: Possible in some states if low-risk; requires understanding minimal remaining risk
3. **Delay it**: Many hospitals can delay until after golden hour/breastfeeding
4. **Request specific timing**: Ask for application during skin-to-skin or breastfeeding

### Before Birth, Do This

- Research your state's legal requirements
- Get STI screening (if you haven't already)
- Discuss with your healthcare team
- Include your preferences in your birth plan
- Understand your actual infection risk
- Know what to watch for in your baby's eyes after discharge

### The Bottom Line

For low-risk pregnancies with prenatal care and negative STI testing, eye ointment prevents a risk that doesn't exist. For higher-risk situations, it remains protective and important.

The most accurate, most evidence-based approach would be individual risk assessment rather than universal application. However, current U.S. law mandates universal application in most states. Within those legal constraints, many hospitals now allow delayed administration (after bonding time) and some states permit parental refusal.

Understanding the evidence—that the disease this procedure was designed to prevent is now rare, that prenatal screening is effective, that several developed nations have moved away from universal prophylaxis—empowers you to make an informed decision aligned with your values and your actual risk.
