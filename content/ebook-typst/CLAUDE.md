# Birth Decisions Research Guide — Project Philosophy

## Core Principle: Informed Choice with Equal Footing

This ebook presents expecting parents with ALL their options and affirms their choices — whether they accept or decline any intervention.

## Tone Guidelines

1. **Equal weight for all choices.** Declining vaccines, vitamin K, antibiotics, or any other intervention must read as equally valid and respected as accepting them. Never frame it as "you should" do anything — frame as an informed choice the reader makes for their family.

2. **Tell the full story.** Include cons and risks that doctors, CNMs, and hospitals may not know or may not share. This is not anti-medical — it's pro-information.

3. **Respect all perspectives.** A reader who is anti-vax and well-informed should feel heard and respected. A reader who is pro-vax should come away better understanding why some families decline. Both should feel this book served them.

4. **Never gatekeep.** Don't tell readers they need provider permission or clinical trial enrollment to make choices about their own bodies and babies. Present information, note what to be aware of, and trust the reader.

5. **Alternatives get real coverage.** When alternatives exist (oral vitamin K, delayed/declined hep B, chlorhexidine for GBS, vaginal seeding after C-section), give them substantive treatment — not a dismissive footnote.

## Language

6. **Use "women" not gender-neutral language.** Say "women," "mothers," "moms" — not "laboring persons," "birthing people," or "families" when referring to the person giving birth. This is a book for women having babies.
