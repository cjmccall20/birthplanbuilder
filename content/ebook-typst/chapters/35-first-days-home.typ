= First Days at Home <ch-first-days-home>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

The first days home are intense: exhaustion, hormones, healing, and learning a new human. This is survival mode. Focus on feeding the baby, resting when possible, and accepting all help offered. Everything else can wait.

== WHAT IT IS

You've left the hospital with a tiny human who depends entirely on you. There are no nurses down the hall anymore. This is the "fourth trimester"---the 12 weeks after birth when both you and baby are adjusting to this new world.

If you haven't already, take a look at #link(<ch-pre-labor-logistics>)[our Pre-Labor Logistics chapter]---setting up your home, stocking meals, arranging help, and getting your practical ducks in a row before baby arrives makes these first days dramatically easier. The more you've prepared in advance, the less you'll be scrambling when you're running on two hours of sleep.

== THE EVIDENCE

*What to expect:*
- *Exhaustion:* Sleep deprivation is real and cumulative. Newborns eat every 2-3 hours around the clock.
- *Hormones:* Massive hormonal shifts happen in the first week. Mood swings, crying, and "baby blues" affect up to 80% of mothers.
- *Physical healing:* Vaginal soreness, lochia (bleeding), breast engorgement, C-section incision pain---your body is recovering from a major event.
- *Breastfeeding challenges:* Milk typically comes in days 2-5, which can be uncomfortable. Latching takes practice.

== PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR MOM

Your body just did something extraordinary. Whether you had a vaginal birth or a cesarean, you are recovering from a significant physical event. Pain is normal. Suffering through it without relief is not required.

=== Vaginal Birth Recovery

Most women who deliver vaginally feel sore for one to three weeks, though it can last longer depending on tearing or episiotomy.

*What to expect:*
- Perineal soreness, especially if you had a tear or stitches
- Swelling and bruising in the vaginal area
- Painful urination for the first few days
- Lochia (postpartum bleeding) that gradually lightens over 2-6 weeks
- Afterpains---uterine cramps that intensify during breastfeeding as your uterus contracts back to size. These can be surprisingly strong, especially with second or subsequent babies.
- Hemorrhoids from pushing

*What helps:*
- _Ice packs:_ Apply to the perineum for 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off during the first 24-48 hours. Many hospitals send you home with instant cold packs. You can also freeze padsicles---maxi pads soaked with witch hazel and aloe, then frozen.
- _Sitz baths:_ Sit in a few inches of warm water for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times per day. You can buy a sitz bath basin that fits over your toilet. This increases blood flow to the perineum and promotes healing.
- _Peri bottle:_ A squirt bottle filled with warm water to rinse the perineum while you urinate (instead of wiping). This reduces stinging and keeps the area clean. Your hospital will likely give you one---use it every time.
- _Witch hazel pads (Tucks):_ Tuck these between a pad and your perineum for cooling, anti-inflammatory relief. You can also line a pad with several for sustained comfort.
- _Stool softeners:_ Your first postpartum bowel movement can be intimidating. Start a stool softener (like Colace) right away---don't wait until you're already struggling. Drink plenty of water and eat fiber-rich foods.
- _Over-the-counter pain relief:_ Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin) is generally safe while breastfeeding and helps with both pain and inflammation. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is also safe. Talk with your provider about what's right for you.
- _Dermoplast spray:_ The blue can (not the red one) provides numbing relief to the perineum. Ask your hospital for one, or buy it at any pharmacy.

=== C-Section Recovery

A cesarean is major abdominal surgery. Recovery takes longer---typically 6-8 weeks for full healing, though most women feel significantly better by 2-3 weeks.

*What to expect:*
- Incision pain that is worst in the first few days and gradually improves
- Difficulty standing up straight, getting out of bed, and lifting anything heavier than your baby
- Gas pain and bloating (your bowels slow down after surgery)
- Numbness or tingling around the incision that can last months
- Lochia (yes, you still bleed even after a C-section)
- Fatigue that may feel more intense due to surgical recovery layered on top of newborn care

*What helps:*
- _Pillow over your incision:_ Hold a pillow firmly against your belly when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or get up. This supports the incision and reduces pain significantly.
- _Roll to get up:_ Don't sit straight up from lying down. Roll onto your side and use your arms to push up. This protects your abdominal muscles and incision.
- _Walk early and often:_ Short, gentle walks (even just around the house) help prevent blood clots, reduce gas pain, and speed recovery. It will hurt. Do it anyway---slowly.
- _Prescribed pain medication:_ Take it on schedule, not just when the pain gets bad. Staying ahead of the pain is easier than trying to catch up. If you're concerned about medication while breastfeeding, talk with your provider---most post-cesarean pain medications are compatible with nursing.
- _Loose, high-waisted clothing:_ Nothing should sit on or rub against your incision. Loose pajama pants, nightgowns, or high-waisted underwear that sits above the incision line.
- _Incision care:_ Keep the incision clean and dry. Watch for signs of infection (redness spreading from the incision, warmth, oozing, foul smell, or fever).

=== When to Call Your Provider About Pain

Some pain is expected. But certain symptoms mean something needs attention:

- Pain that is getting worse instead of better after the first few days
- Fever over 100.4 degrees F
- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour or passing clots larger than a golf ball)
- Foul-smelling discharge from the vagina or incision
- Redness, swelling, or warmth spreading from a C-section incision or perineal tear
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe headache or vision changes
- Pain, redness, or swelling in one leg (possible blood clot)
- Pain that isn't responding to medication at all

Don't talk yourself out of calling. If something feels wrong, call. Your provider would rather hear from you over a false alarm than miss something that matters.

== NUTRITION FOR RECOVERY AND BREASTFEEDING

Your body is healing and---if you're breastfeeding---producing food for another human being around the clock. This is not the time to diet, restrict, or skip meals. Good nutrition directly impacts how fast you recover and how well your body can keep up with everything it's doing.

=== Why Nutrition Matters Now

Pregnancy and birth deplete your body's stores of iron, protein, calcium, and key vitamins. Replenishing those stores helps your tissues heal, supports your immune system, stabilizes your energy, and improves your mood. Women who eat well in the postpartum period report better energy and faster recovery.

=== Extra Calories for Breastfeeding

If you're breastfeeding, your body needs roughly 500 extra calories per day to support milk production. That's a substantial amount---about an extra meal or two large snacks. This isn't the time to count calories or cut back. Your body is working hard, and it needs fuel.

Signs you're not eating enough:
- Persistent fatigue beyond normal newborn exhaustion
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Feeling weak or shaky
- Noticeable drop in milk supply

=== Hydration Is Critical

Dehydration sneaks up on postpartum women, especially those who are breastfeeding. Breast milk is roughly 88% water. If you're not drinking enough, you'll feel it---headaches, fatigue, decreased supply, and constipation.

*Practical tips:*
- Keep a large water bottle everywhere you sit to nurse. Every time you sit down to feed, drink a full glass.
- Aim for at least 80-100 ounces of water per day. More if you're breastfeeding.
- Electrolyte drinks (Body Armor, Liquid IV, or coconut water) can help, especially if plain water is hard to get excited about.
- If your urine is dark yellow, you need more water.

=== Easy, Nutritious Meal and Snack Ideas

You need food you can eat one-handed, prep quickly (or not at all), and that's nutrient-dense. Fancy cooking is not happening right now.

*One-handed snacks:*
- Trail mix with nuts, seeds, and dried fruit
- Granola bars or protein bars
- String cheese or cheese sticks
- Apple slices with peanut butter (pre-sliced)
- Hard-boiled eggs (batch prep ahead of time)
- Yogurt cups or drinkable yogurt
- Banana with almond butter
- Hummus and pita or crackers

*Easy meals:*
- Overnight oats (prep the night before---oats also support milk supply)
- Smoothies with fruit, spinach, protein powder, and nut butter
- Rotisserie chicken with pre-washed salad greens
- Freezer meals you prepped before birth (soups, stews, casseroles, burritos)
- Slow cooker meals your partner or a visitor can throw together
- Sandwiches and wraps---nothing wrong with simple
- Rice bowls with pre-cooked grains and whatever protein you have

*Key nutrients to focus on:*
- _Iron:_ Red meat, spinach, lentils, fortified cereals (especially important if you lost blood during delivery)
- _Protein:_ Eggs, chicken, fish, beans, Greek yogurt, nuts
- _Calcium:_ Dairy, fortified plant milk, leafy greens
- _Omega-3s:_ Salmon, sardines, walnuts, chia seeds (supports baby's brain development through breast milk)
- _Fiber:_ Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans (helps with postpartum constipation)

Accept every meal someone offers to bring you. Sign up for a meal train if people are offering help. This is one of the most genuinely useful things anyone can do for a new family.

== TRACKING: KNOWING WHAT'S NORMAL

In the first days and weeks, you're going to wonder constantly: Is baby eating enough? Are they sleeping too much? Too little? Is this number of diapers normal?

Tracking takes the guesswork out of it.

=== What to Track

- *Diapers:* Wet diapers and dirty diapers. In the early days, diaper counts are one of the best indicators that baby is getting enough to eat. By day 4-5, you should see at least 6 wet diapers per day.
- *Feeds:* How often, how long (or how much, if bottle feeding), and which side if breastfeeding. This helps you notice patterns and gives your pediatrician real data at checkups.
- *Sleep:* When baby slept and for how long. Not because you need to optimize a newborn's schedule---you can't---but because you'll notice patterns emerge over time, and it's reassuring to see that your baby actually is sleeping even when it doesn't feel like it.

=== Use an App

The *Huckleberry* app is an excellent tool for tracking diapers, feeds, and sleep. It's simple to use, even at 3am when you can barely keep your eyes open. You and your partner can both log entries from your own phones, so whoever handled that feeding or diaper change can log it in real time.

Tracking isn't about being obsessive. It's about having data that reassures you baby is eating enough, helps you spot potential issues early, and gives your pediatrician something concrete to work with instead of "I think he's eating okay... maybe?"

#line(length: 100%)

== LACTATION SUPPORT

Even if breastfeeding seems to be going well in the hospital, schedule an appointment with a lactation professional---a CLC (Certified Lactation Counselor) or ideally an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant)---within the first week or two of being home.

=== Why Schedule Even If Things Seem Fine

Many breastfeeding issues don't show up until days or weeks in. A latch that looks okay to you might actually be shallow, leading to nipple damage, pain, and supply problems down the road. A professional can:

- Assess your latch and positioning with fresh, expert eyes
- Do a weighted feed (weigh baby before and after nursing to see exactly how much milk transferred)
- Check for tongue tie or lip tie that might not have been caught in the hospital
- Catch small problems before they become big ones
- Give you confidence that things are actually going well, if they are

=== This Goes Double for First-Time Moms

If this is your first baby, you have never done this before. That's okay. But breastfeeding is a learned skill for both you and your baby. Having a professional watch you nurse, make small adjustments, and confirm you're on the right track can be the difference between pushing through the hard first weeks successfully and giving up out of frustration because nobody told you that your latch needed a small tweak.

=== How to Find Support

- Ask your OB, midwife, or pediatrician for a referral
- Search the ILCA (International Lactation Consultant Association) directory at ilca.org
- Check if your hospital has an outpatient lactation clinic
- Many IBCLCs offer home visits---worth every penny when you don't want to leave the house with a days-old baby
- Insurance often covers lactation visits under the ACA. Call your insurance and ask.
- Your local WIC office also offers free breastfeeding support

See #link(<ch-feeding>)[our Infant Feeding chapter] for more detail on lactation support, credentials, and breastfeeding troubleshooting.

== SLEEP ARRANGEMENTS AND SAFE CO-SLEEPING

Sleep---or the lack of it---dominates the first weeks. Where your baby sleeps matters for safety, feeding, and your own survival.

=== Room-Sharing Makes Nighttime Feeding Easier

Having your baby sleep in the same room as you---at minimum---makes nighttime feeding dramatically more manageable. When baby is right next to your bed, you can hear their early hunger cues (rooting, lip-smacking, small sounds) and respond before they're fully crying. You don't have to fully wake up, walk down a hall, and back. You can nurse or bottle-feed and settle them quickly. The AAP recommends room-sharing (but not bed-sharing) for at least the first six months.

A bassinet or bedside sleeper right next to your bed is the standard setup. Some bassinets have a side that drops down so you can reach baby without even sitting up.

=== The Bed-Sharing Reality

Here's the honest truth: most parents will bed-share at some point, whether they planned to or not. Exhaustion is that powerful. A breastfeeding mom who hasn't slept in 36 hours will fall asleep while nursing in bed. It happens. Studies suggest that as many as 60-70% of breastfeeding mothers in Western countries bed-share at some point in the first few months.

The AAP and most U.S. health organizations recommend against bed-sharing due to SIDS and suffocation risk. That's the official guidance, and it's based on real data---particularly for certain high-risk situations. We're not dismissing that.

But telling exhausted parents "never do this" without teaching them how to do it safely means that when it inevitably happens---at 3am when you can barely function---you haven't prepared. Falling asleep accidentally in a recliner or on a couch with your baby is far more dangerous than planned bed-sharing with safety precautions. Couches and recliners are the most dangerous sleep surfaces for infants.

=== If You Bed-Share: Know How to Do It Safely

The *Safe Sleep Seven* framework (from La Leche League and supported by research from Dr. James McKenna's Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Laboratory at Notre Dame) outlines the conditions under which bed-sharing carries the lowest risk. All seven conditions should be met:

1. *Mom is a nonsmoker.* Smoking---by either parent---significantly increases SIDS risk regardless of sleep arrangement.
2. *Mom is sober.* No alcohol, no drugs (recreational or sedating medications), no anything that impairs your ability to wake and respond to baby.
3. *Mom is breastfeeding.* Breastfeeding mothers naturally adopt a protective "cuddle curl" position and are more responsive to baby's movements and sounds during sleep.
4. *Baby is healthy and full-term.* Premature, low birth weight, or medically fragile babies are at higher risk.
5. *Baby is on their back.* Always place baby on their back to sleep.
6. *Baby is lightly dressed.* No swaddling in an adult bed. Baby's body regulates temperature partly through contact with you.
7. *The sleep surface is safe:*
   - Firm, flat mattress (no waterbeds, no memory foam, no saggy mattresses)
   - No heavy blankets or comforters near baby---use a light sheet or blanket at waist level only
   - No extra pillows near baby
   - No gap between the mattress and headboard or wall where baby could get trapped
   - No other children or pets in the bed

=== The Framework That Matters

Whether you plan to bed-share or not, know this information. Because at some point, in the fog of sleep deprivation, you may find yourself nursing in bed with your eyes closed. If your bed is already set up safely---firm mattress, no heavy blankets, no gaps---that accidental doze-off is much less dangerous. If you fell asleep in a recliner or on a couch with baby on your chest because you were afraid to bring them to bed, the risk is significantly higher.

Preparation isn't permission. It's harm reduction. Know how to do it safely, because it will probably happen.

#line(length: 100%)

== BABY'S NEED TO BE HELD

Your newborn is going to want to be held. Constantly. All the time. Possibly every waking moment and many sleeping moments too. This is not a flaw. This is not you creating bad habits. This is biology.

=== Why Newborns Need So Much Contact

Your baby just spent nine months in a space where they were held continuously. Constant pressure. Constant warmth. Constant sound of your heartbeat. The world outside is enormous, bright, cold, and nothing is touching them. Of course they want to be back in your arms.

Being held is not just emotionally comforting for your baby---it's physiologically regulatory:

- *Temperature:* Your body helps regulate your baby's temperature through skin contact. This is why skin-to-skin works so well.
- *Heart rate and breathing:* Babies' heart rates and breathing patterns stabilize when held against a parent's body. The rhythm of your own heart and lungs provides a template their body syncs to.
- *Stress hormones:* Cortisol (the stress hormone) drops when babies are held. Babies who are left to cry without comfort show elevated cortisol levels.
- *Digestion:* Being held upright after feeds helps with gas and reflux. The gentle motion of being carried supports digestion.

=== You Cannot Spoil a Newborn

This deserves its own heading because you will hear it from someone---a relative, a neighbor, a stranger in the grocery store: "You're going to spoil that baby."

No. You are not. You cannot spoil a newborn. The concept of "spoiling" assumes a baby is manipulating you to get what they want. Newborns are not capable of manipulation. Their brains haven't developed that capacity. When they cry, they need something: food, warmth, comfort, a diaper change, or simply the reassurance that someone is there.

Responding to your baby's needs---picking them up, holding them, comforting them---builds secure attachment. Research consistently shows that babies whose needs are responded to promptly and consistently in infancy actually become *more* independent and secure as they grow, not less.

=== Practical Ways to Hold Baby and Still Function

- *Baby carriers and wraps:* A stretchy wrap (like a Solly or Boba) or a structured carrier lets you hold baby hands-free. Many newborns will sleep for hours in a carrier while you eat, fold laundry, or just move around the house.
- *Take shifts:* If you have a partner, family member, or friend visiting, pass the baby. You don't have to hold baby every minute yourself. Anyone baby is comfortable with can provide the contact they need.
- *Side-lying nursing:* You can nurse lying down, which lets you rest while baby is fed and held.
- *Let the house be messy:* Holding your baby is more important than a clean kitchen. The dishes will wait.

#line(length: 100%)

== YOUR PARTNER'S ROLE

If there's a partner in the picture, their job in the first days home can be summed up simply: *take care of mom so she can take care of baby.*

That's it. That's the job. Everything else flows from there.

=== What "Take Care of Mom" Looks Like

This isn't abstract. It's a list of concrete, daily actions:

- *Bring food and water.* Every time mom sits down to nurse, bring a glass of water and a snack. She needs both and won't get them herself because she'll have a baby attached to her.
- *Handle meals.* Whether that's heating up freezer meals, ordering delivery, or cooking something simple---make sure she's fed without having to think about it.
- *Do laundry.* Baby laundry piles up astonishingly fast. Adult laundry does too. Just keep the machine running.
- *Manage visitors.* Be the gatekeeper. If visitors are adding stress instead of help, send them home. If visitors are staying too long, wrap it up. Mom shouldn't have to be the one to say "we need to rest now."
- *Handle older children.* If there are older kids, they need attention, meals, bedtime routines, and reassurance. This is a huge way to lighten the load.
- *Run errands.* Pharmacy, grocery, pediatrician appointments---keep the logistics running.
- *Protect her sleep.* If mom can get one stretch of 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep per day, it's transformative. Take the baby between feeds, handle diaper changes, and let her sleep.
- *Do the dishes, take out the trash, wipe down the bathroom.* Not because she asked. Because you noticed.

=== Partner Bonding

Taking care of mom is the primary job, but that doesn't mean partners are just support staff. The first days are also a time for partners to bond deeply with this new baby.

*Ways partners bond:*
- *Skin-to-skin contact:* Take your shirt off and hold baby against your bare chest. The same temperature regulation, heart rate stabilization, and cortisol reduction that happens with mom happens with partners too. This is powerful.
- *Diaper changes:* Yes, really. The physical closeness, the eye contact, the routine of it---diaper changes are bonding time. You'll do hundreds of them. Lean in.
- *Burping and soothing:* After feeds, take the baby for burping. Walk them, rock them, talk to them. Babies learn your voice, your smell, your rhythm.
- *Bath time:* When baby's ready for baths, this can become a special partner-baby routine.
- *Talking and singing:* Your baby has been hearing your voice for months from inside the womb. Keep talking to them. They know you.

Partners who are actively involved from day one report feeling more confident, more bonded, and more competent as parents. Don't wait for mom to hand you the baby. Reach for them.

== WARNING SIGNS

Not everything that feels scary is dangerous, but some things need immediate attention. Trust your instincts---if something feels wrong, call.

=== Warning Signs in MOM---Call Your Provider:

- Fever over 100.4 degrees F
- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour or passing large clots)
- Severe headache or vision changes
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Painful, red, swollen area on leg (blood clot)
- Foul-smelling vaginal discharge
- Redness or warmth spreading from C-section incision
- Thoughts of harming yourself or baby
- Sadness or anxiety that doesn't improve after 2 weeks or that feels overwhelming

=== Warning Signs in BABY---Call Pediatrician:

- Fever over 100.4 degrees F (rectal)
- Fewer than 6 wet diapers per day after day 4
- Yellow skin that worsens (jaundice)
- Difficulty breathing
- Won't wake to feed
- Inconsolable crying
- Umbilical cord area red, oozing, or foul-smelling

#line(length: 100%)

== OUR TAKE

*Accept help.* Every casserole, every offer to hold the baby while you shower, every load of laundry someone does for you. Say yes.

*Lower your standards.* The house will be messy. You might not shower daily. That's fine.

*Sleep when baby sleeps* is cliche because it's true. At least once a day, nap when baby naps.

*Limit visitors* who aren't helpful. If they're not bringing food or doing dishes, they can wait.

*Hold your baby.* As much as you want. As much as they want. You're not spoiling them. You're building a human who knows they're safe.

*Feed yourself.* You cannot pour from an empty cup. Eat real food, drink water constantly, and don't feel guilty about eating a lot---your body needs it.

*Get lactation help early.* Even if breastfeeding seems fine. A professional set of eyes can catch what you can't see and save you weeks of struggle.

*Know your sleep setup.* Whether you're using a bassinet or bed-sharing, make sure the space is safe. Read the Safe Sleep Seven even if you don't plan to bed-share. Plans change at 3am.

*Partners: step up.* The first two weeks set the tone. Be proactive. Don't wait to be asked. Mom is recovering from a physical event and learning to feed a new human---she needs you in the trenches, not on the sidelines.

*Baby blues vs. PPD:* Baby blues (weepiness, mood swings) should improve within 2 weeks. If you're still struggling---or if you have thoughts of harm---that's postpartum depression and it's treatable. Tell someone. Call your provider. There is no shame in it, and early treatment makes a real difference.

This phase is hard. It's also temporary. You'll find your rhythm.
