= First Days at Home <ch-first-days-home>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

The first days home are intense: exhaustion, hormones, healing, and learning a new human. This is survival mode. Focus on feeding the baby, resting when possible, and accepting all help offered. Everything else can wait.

== WHAT IT IS

You've left the hospital with a tiny human who depends entirely on you. There are no nurses down the hall anymore. This is the "fourth trimester"—the 12 weeks after birth when both you and baby are adjusting to this new world.

== THE EVIDENCE

*What to expect:*
- *Exhaustion:* Sleep deprivation is real and cumulative. Newborns eat every 2-3 hours around the clock.
- *Hormones:* Massive hormonal shifts happen in the first week. Mood swings, crying, and "baby blues" affect up to 80% of mothers.
- *Physical healing:* Vaginal soreness, lochia (bleeding), breast engorgement, C-section incision pain—your body is recovering from a major event.
- *Breastfeeding challenges:* Milk typically comes in days 2-5, which can be uncomfortable. Latching takes practice.

*Warning signs in MOM—call your provider:*
- Fever over 100.4°F
- Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour)
- Severe headache or vision changes
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Painful, red, swollen area on leg (blood clot)
- Thoughts of harming yourself or baby
- Sadness/anxiety that doesn't improve after 2 weeks

*Warning signs in BABY—call pediatrician:*
- Fever over 100.4°F (rectal)
- Fewer than 6 wet diapers per day after day 4
- Yellow skin that worsens (jaundice)
- Difficulty breathing
- Won't wake to feed
- Inconsolable crying
- Umbilical cord area red, oozing, or foul-smelling

*The fourth trimester concept:* Your baby is still adjusting to life outside the womb. They need closeness, feeding on demand, and your presence. This isn't spoiling—it's biologically normal.

== OUR TAKE

*Accept help.* Every casserole, every offer to hold the baby while you shower, every load of laundry someone does for you. Say yes.

*Lower your standards.* The house will be messy. You might not shower daily. That's fine.

*Sleep when baby sleeps* is cliché because it's true. At least once a day, nap when baby naps.

*Limit visitors* who aren't helpful. If they're not bringing food or doing dishes, they can wait.

*Baby blues vs. PPD:* Baby blues (weepiness, mood swings) should improve within 2 weeks. If you're still struggling—or if you have thoughts of harm—that's postpartum depression and it's treatable. Tell someone.

This phase is hard. It's also temporary. You'll find your rhythm.
