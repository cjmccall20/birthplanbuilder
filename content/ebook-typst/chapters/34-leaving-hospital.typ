= Chapter 34: When to Leave the Hospital <ch-leaving-hospital>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Vaginal births typically stay 24-48 hours; C-sections stay 2-4 days #citation[1]. If you and baby are healthy, you can often leave earlier than the default. You can also stay longer if you need more recovery time or support.

== WHAT IT IS

Hospital discharge timing has shortened dramatically over decades. What used to be week-long stays are now 1-2 days for vaginal births. The question is: What's the right amount of time for YOU?

== THE EVIDENCE

*Typical stays:*
- Uncomplicated vaginal birth: 24-48 hours #citation[1]
- C-section: 2-4 days #citation[1]
- Complications: Varies based on situation

*What hospitals typically expect before discharge:*
- Baby passes hearing screening (offered at the hospital, can also be done outpatient)
- Newborn screening (heel prick) completed (this is offered as standard practice, though parents can decline or arrange to have it done later — see Chapter 35 for more)
- Baby feeding adequately (milk coming in or colostrum sufficient)
- Baby urinating and stooling appropriately
- Pediatrician/provider examines baby
- Mother's bleeding is under control
- Mother can urinate on her own
- Mother has adequate pain management plan
- Car seat available

*Early discharge considerations:*
- Some healthy mothers and babies leave at 24 hours
- Pediatricians will often push for a follow-up appointment within 1-2 days #citation[2]. The pediatrician at the hospital is often available if you don't already have one lined up.
- Without insurance, the cost of an extended stay can be significant, so leaving earlier could be a cost consideration
- Some hospitals can "discharge" you from care while allowing you to stay another night if you're interested — worth asking about

*Reasons to stay longer:*
- Breastfeeding difficulties (lactation support available in hospital)
- Concerns about baby's jaundice
- Need for rest and recovery
- Limited support at home
- C-section recovery requiring more monitoring

*Reasons to go home sooner:*
- No interruptions from nurses and staff checking in throughout the night
- Lower risk of hospital-acquired infection for both mother and baby
- Better rest in your own bed, on your own schedule
- More comfortable environment overall — your own food, your own space, your own routine
- For families with other children, being home sooner helps everyone settle in

*Insurance coverage:* The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act requires insurers to cover at least 48 hours for vaginal birth, 96 hours for C-section #citation[1]. You're entitled to this time if you want it.

== OUR TAKE

Some families prefer to leave as soon as possible; others find value in using the full stay. Both approaches are valid.

*If you want to stay:* The hospital has nurses, lactation consultants, and support available around the clock. If breastfeeding help or newborn care guidance matters to you, use that time.

*If you want to go home:* Your own bed, your own space, and no one waking you up every few hours for vitals checks can make a real difference in recovery. If you're healthy, baby is healthy, and you feel ready, earlier discharge is a perfectly reasonable choice.

*First-time parents:* Some find the full 48 hours helpful for learning the basics of newborn care with professional support nearby. Others find the hospital environment more stressful than restful and recover better at home.

*Experienced parents:* You may be fine leaving earlier — you've done this before and know what to expect.

*After C-section:* Recovery from major surgery takes time. That said, recovery happens at home too, and some women prefer to do it there.

*Ask what you need:* "Can we have the lactation consultant visit again?" "Can we stay one more night?" "Can we be discharged early?" Advocate for what serves your recovery.

You'll know when you're ready.
