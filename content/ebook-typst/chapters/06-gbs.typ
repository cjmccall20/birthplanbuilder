== One-Page Overview

#callout[
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a common bacterium carried by 15-35% of pregnant women in their vagina or rectum.#citation[1] During pregnancy, you'll be offered a routine screening around 35-37 weeks. If you test positive, providers will recommend IV antibiotics during labor. Some families accept; others decline. Both are legitimate, informed choices.

Here's what you need to know:

- *Colonization is not infection.* Most women who carry GBS have no symptoms and healthy babies. Roughly 98-99% of babies born to untreated GBS-positive mothers do not develop infection.

- *When infection does occur, it's serious.* Early-onset GBS disease can cause blood infections, pneumonia, or meningitis in newborns. Without antibiotics, this affects approximately 1-2 babies per 100 GBS-positive births (1-2%).

- *Antibiotics reduce this risk further.* IV antibiotics during labor bring the rate down to roughly 0.2-0.4%.#citation[2] That's a meaningful reduction in relative terms, from a number that was already low.

- *Antibiotics come with real trade-offs.* They disrupt your baby's developing gut bacteria at a critical window for immune system development. They carry risks of allergic reaction, yeast infections, and contribute to antibiotic resistance. These are not trivial concerns.

- *Alternatives exist.* They range from evidence-based (close monitoring after birth) to promising but unproven (probiotics, chlorhexidine wash). Families who research these options and choose a different path are making an informed decision.

*The Bottom Line:* This decision involves weighing a small but real risk of a serious acute infection against real and emerging concerns about the intervention itself. Neither accepting nor declining antibiotics is the "right" answer. What matters is understanding the actual numbers, the trade-offs on both sides, and making a decision that reflects your values and your specific situation.

== What is GBS?

=== Colonization vs. Infection: An Important Difference

Group B Streptococcus is a type of bacteria that naturally lives in the bodies of many adults. In pregnant women, it often resides in the vagina or rectum without causing any problems. This is called colonization, and it's completely different from an infection.

Between 15% and 35% of pregnant women carry GBS at any given time.#citation[1] In the US, about 21-30% of women test positive. These numbers vary by region and population. The vast majority of these women will have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies regardless of whether they receive antibiotics.

Here's the key point: Having GBS colonization doesn't mean you're sick. Most carriers have no symptoms whatsoever. The bacteria is simply present, living as part of your body's normal bacterial ecosystem. GBS colonization is also transient --- it comes and goes. You may test positive at 36 weeks and be negative at delivery, or vice versa.

=== Actual Risk to Your Baby

When we talk about GBS risk, we're talking about the possibility of the bacteria passing to your baby during birth and causing early-onset GBS disease. This disease can manifest as:

- Blood infection (bacteremia) --- most common
- Pneumonia
- Meningitis (about 10% of early-onset cases)#citation[3]

Without any treatment, approximately 1-2% of babies born to GBS-positive mothers develop early-onset disease. Put another way: *98-99 out of 100 babies born to untreated GBS-positive mothers remain healthy.* Most babies exposed to GBS during birth clear the bacteria on their own without any issue.

When GBS disease does occur, it typically appears within the first 24-48 hours of life. Even with treatment, meningitis from GBS carries a 4-6% mortality rate and causes permanent neurological problems in 20-30% of survivors.#citation[3]

So while GBS disease is uncommon, the consequences when it does happen can be serious. This is why providers take it seriously --- and also why many families who decline antibiotics choose close newborn monitoring as their alternative strategy.

#line(length: 100%)

== IV Antibiotics During Labor: The Standard Recommendation

=== How It Works

If you test positive for GBS at your 35-37 week screening, the standard recommendation in the United States is intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor. Not during pregnancy. Not before labor starts. Specifically during active labor.

Here's what happens:
- You'll receive an IV line in your arm
- The first dose is typically 5 million units of penicillin (or 2 grams of ampicillin as an alternative)#citation[1]
- Follow-up doses are given every 4 hours until delivery
- If you have a penicillin allergy, alternatives like cefazolin, clindamycin, or vancomycin are available

The antibiotics travel through your bloodstream, cross the placenta, and reach your baby. This creates antibiotic levels in your baby's blood high enough to kill GBS bacteria during the birth process.

*The 4-hour threshold:* Ideally, you receive at least 4 hours of antibiotics before delivery. Studies show that after 4 hours, the antibiotic concentration in your baby's blood reaches optimal levels.#citation[1] However, the guidelines state: no medically necessary procedure should be delayed to achieve 4 hours. Even shorter durations provide some protection --- though how much is debated.

=== What Antibiotics Accomplish

The most commonly cited statistic is that intrapartum antibiotics reduce early-onset GBS disease by approximately 83%.#citation[2]

This figure comes from a Cochrane review that combined data from three randomized controlled trials.#citation[2] In absolute numbers:
- Without antibiotics for GBS-positive mothers: approximately 1-2 babies per 100 births develop early-onset disease
- With antibiotics: approximately 2-4 babies per 1,000 births develop disease

In population terms, the CDC estimates that widespread GBS screening and treatment has prevented thousands of cases of early GBS disease since the 1990s.#citation[1]

These are real numbers worth knowing. They are also numbers that deserve context: the baseline risk without antibiotics is already low for most women, and the reduction --- while meaningful --- is from a small number to a smaller number.

#line(length: 100%)

== The Case Against Antibiotics: What Providers May Not Share

Antibiotics are an intervention, and like all interventions, they come with trade-offs. Many providers present GBS antibiotics as a straightforward, low-risk choice. The full picture is more nuanced. Here are the real concerns.

=== Microbiome Disruption

This is the most significant and least-discussed trade-off. Your baby's gut bacteria are in a critical assembly phase during and immediately after birth. Unlike an adult's microbiome (which is relatively stable), a newborn's gut is being colonized for the very first time. Specific bacteria arrive in a particular order, and this foundational community shapes your baby's developing immune system, establishes intestinal barrier function, and influences dozens of health outcomes that persist into adulthood.

When you receive IV antibiotics during labor, those antibiotics cross the placenta and reach your baby. Research shows that antibiotic-exposed infants have:

- *Lower bacterial diversity* at all time points in early life
- *Reduced beneficial Bacteroides species* --- still suppressed 3 months after exposure ends
- *Decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus* --- species crucial for immune development
- *Increased potentially harmful bacteria* like Enterobacteriaceae
- *Delayed recovery* --- sometimes taking many months to normalize#citation[4]

What's striking is that infants, unlike adults, don't have an established "normal" to return to. The antibiotics don't just temporarily suppress bacteria; they disrupt the assembly process itself during the most critical window for immune system calibration.

=== The Eczema, Allergy, and Long-Term Connection

This microbiome disruption appears to have real downstream consequences. A 2024 study from the CHILD cohort (over 1,000 infants) found that babies exposed to systemic antibiotics in the first year of life had an 81% increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis (eczema), with a dose-response relationship --- each additional antibiotic course corresponded to higher risk.#citation[5]

The emerging science connects early microbiome disruption to what's sometimes called the "hygiene hypothesis" or, more recently, microbiome science. In Western countries with high antibiotic use, rates of allergies, asthma, eczema, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease have dramatically increased over the past 50 years.#citation[6] In populations with greater microbial diversity and less antibiotic use, these conditions remain rare.

The mechanism appears to work through immune system training: a diverse, healthy microbiome in early life "teaches" the developing immune system to respond appropriately. Without this microbial education, the immune system appears prone to overreaction (allergies) and dysregulation (autoimmune conditions).

This research is still evolving, and no one can tell you exactly what your baby's long-term risk is from a single course of intrapartum antibiotics. But dismissing these concerns as theoretical would be inaccurate --- the microbiome data is robust, and the associations are consistent across multiple studies.

=== Antibiotic Resistance

Overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance --- one of the most serious global health threats. GBS strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics are already increasing. Resistance to clindamycin (a primary alternative for penicillin-allergic women) has risen to 15-40% in some populations, and erythromycin resistance is even higher. Each round of population-wide antibiotic use accelerates this trend.

For the individual family, this matters because: if resistant GBS strains become more common, the antibiotics that are supposed to protect babies may become less effective over time. The very strategy meant to prevent GBS disease could gradually undermine itself.

=== Allergic Reactions

Penicillin, the first-line GBS antibiotic, carries a risk of allergic reaction:

- *Anaphylaxis* (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction): approximately 1 in 10,000 administrations.#citation[7] This is rare, but it happens during labor --- a time when an anaphylactic reaction is especially dangerous for both mother and baby.
- *Milder allergic reactions* (rash, hives, itching): more common, occurring in 1-10% of patients depending on the study.
- Some women discover a penicillin allergy for the first time during labor, which can complicate an already intense experience.

Alternative antibiotics (cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin) each carry their own side effect profiles and may be less effective against GBS.

=== Yeast Infections (Thrush)

Antibiotics kill bacteria indiscriminately --- including the beneficial bacteria that keep yeast in check. Yeast overgrowth (candida) is a common post-antibiotic complication:

- *Maternal vaginal yeast infections* are common after IV antibiotic exposure
- *Thrush in baby* (oral candida) can develop in the first weeks of life
- Thrush can make breastfeeding painful and difficult, potentially undermining one of the best tools for microbiome recovery
- Treating thrush often requires antifungal medication for both mother and baby, adding another intervention

=== Disruption of Natural Processes

Some researchers and clinicians argue that the window of birth and immediate postpartum is the single most important period for microbial seeding --- the process by which a baby acquires its founding microbiome from the mother. Introducing broad-spectrum antibiotics at precisely this moment disrupts a process that evolved over millions of years. The long-term immune implications of this disruption are not yet fully understood, but the concern is scientifically grounded and growing.

#line(length: 100%)

== Alternative Approaches

Families who decline IV antibiotics have several options. These range from evidence-based strategies with established safety records to experimental approaches with limited data. We present them honestly so you can evaluate what fits your situation.

=== Close Monitoring Without Antibiotics

This is the most common alternative chosen by families who decline GBS antibiotics, and it has the strongest practical track record.

*How it works:* You decline IV antibiotics and instead arrange for close monitoring of your baby for 48 hours after birth. You and your care team watch for early signs of infection, including:
- Temperature instability (fever or hypothermia)
- Rapid or labored breathing
- Poor feeding or lethargy
- Irritability or high-pitched cry
- Skin color changes (pale, gray, or mottled)

*The rationale:* Since 98-99% of babies born to untreated GBS-positive mothers do fine, monitoring allows you to catch the rare case of infection early while avoiding routine antibiotic exposure for the vast majority who don't need it. Early-onset GBS disease typically presents within 24-48 hours, and when caught early, it responds well to antibiotic treatment.

*Important considerations:*
- This approach requires you (and ideally your partner or support person) to be educated about warning signs and committed to vigilant observation
- It works best with a provider who supports your decision and will respond promptly if concerns arise
- If you're planning a home birth and declining antibiotics, discuss with your midwife in advance what the transfer plan would be if you notice warning signs
- This is the approach used by default in countries that use risk-based screening (UK, Netherlands, New Zealand), where the majority of GBS-positive women do not receive antibiotics and outcomes remain excellent

*This is a legitimate, informed choice.* You are not "doing nothing" --- you are choosing active surveillance over prophylactic medication, the same approach many developed nations use as standard care.

=== Chlorhexidine Vaginal Wash

Chlorhexidine is a topical antiseptic solution that can be used as a vaginal wash during labor. It's used in several countries outside the US as an alternative or complement to IV antibiotics.

*How it works:* The vagina is rinsed with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution every 6 hours during labor. The antiseptic kills bacteria on contact and its effects last 3-6 hours. The appeal is that it works locally without entering your or your baby's bloodstream and doesn't carry the systemic side effects of IV antibiotics.

*The evidence is mixed:*

A Cochrane review found that vaginal chlorhexidine during labor did not clearly reduce rates of early-onset GBS disease in the studies reviewed.#citation[8] However, one well-designed study found that "intrapartum vaginal flushings with chlorhexidine in colonized mothers display the same efficacy as ampicillin in preventing vertical transmission of group B streptococcus." Other studies show reduced GBS colonization of babies, even if the clinical significance is debated.

*Limitations:*
- Chlorhexidine only works locally in the vagina and birth canal. Unlike IV antibiotics, it doesn't enter your baby's bloodstream, which means it may not help if bacteria have already reached the amniotic fluid
- It must be applied before your water breaks to be most effective, and reapplied every few hours
- It is a broad antiseptic --- it reduces all vaginal bacteria, not just GBS
- The Cochrane reviewers noted that studies had methodological limitations

*Hibiclens wipes:* Some families use over-the-counter Hibiclens (chlorhexidine gluconate 4%) wipes or wash during labor. This is a more accessible version of the same approach. Evidence specifically for OTC Hibiclens is limited, but the active ingredient is the same. Some midwives are familiar with this option and can guide its use.

*Current use:* Chlorhexidine is used as standard GBS prevention in some low- and middle-resource countries. It's inexpensive, doesn't require IV access, and avoids systemic antibiotic exposure. In the US, it's not considered standard care, but this reflects guideline preferences more than a clear evidence showing it's ineffective.

=== Probiotics to Reduce GBS Colonization

Some evidence suggests that specific probiotic strains can reduce GBS colonization in late pregnancy, potentially allowing you to test negative before delivery.

*What the research shows:*

A meta-analysis of six clinical trials found that probiotics decreased the likelihood of a positive GBS test by 44%.#citation[9] Some individual studies showed stronger effects:

- In one study, 43% of women taking specific probiotic strains (L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14) tested negative by delivery, compared to only 18% of controls#citation[9]
- The specific strains matter enormously --- generic probiotics show less effect
- Starting after 30 weeks seems more effective than earlier

*Important limitations:* Most studies had methodological weaknesses. More importantly, while probiotics may reduce colonization, there's no clinical evidence yet that they actually reduce rates of newborn disease. You could take probiotics, retest negative, and still carry GBS at delivery. This approach is promising and under active investigation, but not yet proven as a reliable alternative.

*Practical note:* If you're interested in probiotics, look for products specifically containing L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14, the strains with the most research behind them.#citation[9] Some women use both oral and vaginal probiotic preparations.

=== Garlic

Some midwives recommend vaginal garlic suppositories (a peeled garlic clove inserted vaginally) to reduce GBS colonization in the weeks before delivery. Garlic has known antimicrobial properties in laboratory settings.

*The evidence:* There are no clinical trials evaluating garlic for GBS prevention. The evidence is entirely anecdotal --- based on individual reports from midwives and mothers, not controlled research. Some women report retesting negative after using garlic, but without controlled studies, it's impossible to know whether this reflects the garlic working or the natural fluctuation of GBS colonization.

*Considerations:*
- Garlic is generally considered safe, though vaginal irritation is possible
- It will not give you the same confidence as a proven intervention
- If you choose this approach, consider retesting before labor to see if your GBS status has changed
- Be honest with yourself about the level of evidence: this is folk medicine, not evidence-based practice, and that's a distinction worth sitting with

=== Risk-Based Approach (Monitoring Risk Factors)

Not all countries use universal screening. The UK, Netherlands, and New Zealand use a risk-based approach: they don't test everyone, but instead give antibiotics only to women who develop specific risk factors during labor (preterm labor, fever, prolonged ruptured membranes, etc.).

*The trade-off:* The US approach treats more women with antibiotics but achieves somewhat lower disease rates. The UK approach treats fewer women (avoiding antibiotics for the majority) but accepts slightly higher rates of this rare disease. Different countries have made different judgments about that balance, and neither approach is obviously wrong.

Some families in the US adopt a modified version: they test positive for GBS, decline routine antibiotics, but agree in advance to accept antibiotics if risk factors develop during labor (such as fever, water broken for 18+ hours, or preterm delivery). This hybrid approach targets antibiotics to higher-risk situations while avoiding routine use.

A large UK trial (GBS3) is comparing universal screening to the risk-based approach, with results expected in 2026.#citation[10]

=== How to Think About These Alternatives

It's worth being direct about where each alternative stands:

- *Close monitoring:* Evidence-based. Used as standard care in multiple developed nations. The strongest alternative for families declining antibiotics.
- *Chlorhexidine wash:* Some evidence of benefit. Used internationally. Mixed results in studies. A reasonable option, especially combined with monitoring.
- *Probiotics:* Promising research on reducing colonization. Not yet proven to prevent disease. Worth considering as a complement, not a replacement.
- *Garlic:* Anecdotal only. No clinical evidence. If you choose this, pair it with retesting and a backup plan.
- *Risk-based approach:* Evidence-based as a system (used by entire countries). A sensible middle ground for families who want to avoid routine antibiotics but accept them if risk factors arise.

No alternative has the same level of evidence as IV antibiotics for preventing early-onset GBS disease. But IV antibiotics also carry trade-offs that alternatives don't. Your choice depends on how you weigh these different risks and values.

#line(length: 100%)

== If You Choose Antibiotics: Mitigation Strategies

If you decide to receive intrapartum antibiotics (or circumstances during labor make it the right call), here's what research suggests for supporting your baby's gut recovery:

=== Breastfeeding

This is the most important mitigation factor. Breast milk contains special sugars called HMOs (human milk oligosaccharides) that specifically feed beneficial bacteria like B. infantis.#citation[11]

Studies show that antibiotic-exposed infants who were breastfed at 3 months had significantly better microbiota recovery and lower rates of asthma later in childhood.#citation[4] The protective effect was traced directly to recovery of Bifidobacterium in the gut.

If breastfeeding is your plan, know that it becomes even more valuable if your baby has been exposed to antibiotics.

=== Probiotics for Baby

Research shows that giving babies probiotics containing Bifidobacterium infantis in the first weeks of life can help establish this crucial species and reduce harmful bacteria. These typically come as drops that can be added to breast milk or formula.

Common regimens involve daily supplementation for 3-6 months. Look for products specifically designed for infants with strains like B. infantis.

=== Additional Strategies

- *Avoid unnecessary antibiotics in infancy.* If your baby gets a cold or other viral illness, resist pressure for "just in case" antibiotics. Viral infections don't respond to antibiotics, and each course compounds the microbiome disruption.

- *Consider maternal probiotics if breastfeeding.* Some research suggests that when you take probiotics, it can influence your breast milk composition and help your baby's microbiome recover.

- *Talk to your pediatrician about formula additives* if you're not breastfeeding. Standard formula lacks the microbiota-supporting components found in breast milk; added prebiotics or probiotics may help.

These strategies don't completely undo antibiotic exposure, but they can meaningfully promote recovery of beneficial bacteria.

#line(length: 100%)

== Making Your Decision

=== Understanding Your Individual Risk

The often-cited 1-2% risk of GBS disease for untreated GBS-positive mothers is an overall population average. Your personal risk may be significantly lower or higher depending on specific factors.

*Factors that increase your baseline risk:*

*Demographic and colonization factors:*
- *African American/Black race:* Early-onset GBS disease occurs 2-3 times more frequently in Black infants compared to white infants.#citation[12] Research shows Black women also have higher rates of GBS colonization and are more likely to convert from GBS-negative to positive in late pregnancy.
- *Maternal age under 20:* Young maternal age is associated with higher GBS disease rates
- *GBS found in urine during pregnancy:* This indicates heavy colonization and significantly increases transmission risk
- *Previous baby with early-onset GBS disease:* This is one of the strongest risk factors

*Labor and delivery factors:*
- *Preterm delivery (before 37 weeks):* Premature babies are at substantially higher risk
- *Prolonged ruptured membranes (18+ hours):* The longer membranes are ruptured, the greater the exposure
- *Fever during labor (100.4°F/38°C or higher):* Indicates possible infection and increases risk substantially
- *Chorioamnionitis (intraamniotic infection):* Greatly increases risk

*Factors that lower your risk:*
- *Planned cesarean before labor begins:* Essentially eliminates transmission (baby doesn't pass through birth canal)
- *Quick delivery after membranes rupture:* Less exposure time means lower transmission risk
- *Low bacterial load:* Not all GBS-positive results are equal; light colonization carries less risk than heavy

=== Thinking It Through

*If you have additional risk factors* (previous GBS baby, preterm labor, fever during labor, prolonged ruptured membranes, GBS in urine), the risk of GBS disease is higher than the population average. Many families in this situation feel the benefit of antibiotics clearly outweighs the trade-offs, and that's a well-reasoned choice.

*If you're GBS-positive with no additional risk factors* (healthy pregnancy, full-term, no prior GBS baby, membranes intact), your baseline risk is on the lower end of the spectrum --- likely around 1% or less. With antibiotics, it drops to about 0.2%. Without antibiotics, close monitoring catches the rare infection early. In this situation, reasonable, well-informed people make different choices depending on how they weigh acute versus long-term risks.

*If you feel strongly about avoiding unnecessary antibiotics,* you are not being reckless. You are making the same calculation that several countries make at the policy level. Close monitoring is a real strategy with a real track record. Consider having a clear plan: know what signs to watch for, agree with your provider on circumstances that would change your mind (fever, prolonged rupture, etc.), and make sure your support team is on the same page.

*If you feel more comfortable accepting antibiotics,* that is equally valid. The reduction in GBS risk is real, and mitigation strategies (breastfeeding, probiotics) can help offset the microbiome impact. You don't need to feel guilty about choosing the standard recommendation.

=== Questions for Your Provider

Here are questions worth asking before you're in labor:

*About your individual situation:*
- "What is my specific risk for early-onset GBS disease based on my situation?"
- "Do I have any factors that make my risk higher or lower than average?"

*About alternatives:*
- "Can I request to be retested closer to my due date to see if I'm still positive?" (GBS colonization can come and go; you may test positive at 36 weeks but be negative by delivery)
- "If I decline antibiotics, what monitoring protocol would you recommend for my baby after birth?"
- "What would make you recommend I change my mind during labor?" (fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, etc.)

*About logistics:*
- "What happens if labor moves too fast for 4 hours of antibiotics?"
- "If I initially decline, can I change my mind during labor if circumstances change?"

*About mitigation:*
- "If I do receive antibiotics, what can I do to support my baby's microbiome recovery?"

== Our Take

#our-take[
GBS is one of those decisions where reasonable people, looking at the same evidence, genuinely arrive at different conclusions --- and that's okay.

The medical establishment has framed GBS antibiotics as routine and straightforward for decades, and the intervention has prevented real cases of serious newborn infection. That matters. But the framing has also meant that most families never hear about the trade-offs: the microbiome disruption, the antibiotic resistance concerns, the allergic reaction risk, or the fact that most babies do fine without antibiotics.

Here's how we see the landscape:

*The case for antibiotics is strongest* when additional risk factors are present --- previous GBS baby, preterm labor, fever during labor, prolonged ruptured membranes, or heavy colonization. In these situations, the risk of GBS disease is meaningfully higher, and reducing it with antibiotics makes clear sense.

*The case for declining antibiotics is strongest* when you're GBS-positive with an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, full-term, with no additional risk factors, and you have a plan for close monitoring. In this situation, you're weighing a roughly 1% chance of a treatable (if caught early) infection against guaranteed antibiotic exposure with known microbiome effects and other trade-offs. Many families --- and many midwives and some physicians --- find that the numbers favor monitoring in this scenario.

*Most situations fall somewhere in between,* and that's where your values, your risk tolerance, and your birth setting matter most.

What we want you to take away: if you accept GBS antibiotics, you've made a sound choice backed by decades of data. If you decline them after doing your research and putting a monitoring plan in place, you've also made a sound choice --- one that aligns with how several developed nations approach GBS as standard policy. Neither path requires apology or justification.
