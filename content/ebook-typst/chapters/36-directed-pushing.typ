= Chapter 36: Directed vs Spontaneous Pushing <ch-directed-pushing>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Spontaneous pushing (following your body's urges) and directed pushing (coached breath-holding) represent two different approaches, each with different outcomes documented in research.

== WHAT IT IS

*Directed pushing (Valsalva/purple pushing):*
- Staff tells you when and how to push
- "Take a deep breath, hold it, push for 10 seconds, repeat!"
- Standard in most US hospitals #citation[1]
- Called "purple pushing" because mothers' faces often turn purple from breath-holding

*Spontaneous pushing:*
- You push when you feel the urge
- Follow your body's natural rhythm
- May involve grunting, shorter pushes, breathing between efforts
- More common in birth centers and home births #citation[2]

== THE EVIDENCE

*Why directed pushing became standard:*
- Continuous fetal monitoring created pressure to speed up pushing
- The assumption was that faster = better
- Staff could "coach" even when the mother had no urge to push

*What research shows about spontaneous pushing:* #citation[3]
- No difference in time to delivery in most studies
- Less fatigue for the mother
- Lower rates of pelvic floor damage
- Better fetal oxygenation (baby gets more oxygen between pushes)
- Lower rates of abnormal fetal heart patterns

*Problems with directed pushing:* #citation[3]
- Breath-holding reduces oxygen to baby
- Sustained pressure damages pelvic floor muscles
- More exhausting for mother
- Can cause hemorrhoids and vaginal tearing
- Ignores the body's natural reflex

*Benefits of directed pushing:*
- Provides helpful structure for first-time mothers who feel uncertain about what to do
- Useful with epidural when the natural pushing urge is reduced or absent #citation[4]
- Can help coordinate pushing efforts during difficult or prolonged deliveries
- Some women find the coaching reassuring and prefer having guidance
- May shorten the pushing phase in some circumstances

*The epidural factor:*
- Epidurals can block the urge to push #citation[4]
- Some direction may be necessary to know when contractions happen
- "Laboring down" (waiting for baby to descend before pushing) reduces need for intense directed pushing #citation[4]

*What the research recommends:*
- ACOG acknowledges both approaches are acceptable #citation[5]
- Many midwifery organizations prefer spontaneous pushing #citation[6]
- Upright positions often make spontaneous pushing more intuitive

== PUSHING WITH THE CREST: THE BRADLEY METHOD APPROACH

One of the most practical spontaneous pushing techniques comes from the Bradley Method #citation[7]. Instead of pushing throughout an entire contraction — which is exhausting and wastes energy — you wait until the contraction crests at its most intense point before adding your voluntary effort.

Here is how it works: a contraction builds, peaks (usually about halfway through), and then fades. The peak is when your uterine muscles are contracting hardest on their own. If you push at that moment, you are adding your voluntary effort on top of maximum involuntary force — the most pushing power with the least wasted energy.

*The technique:*
- When you feel a contraction beginning, do not push immediately
- Take two very deep, slow breaths as the contraction builds
- By the end of those two breaths, the contraction is reaching its crest
- Now push — bearing down with the wave at its strongest
- You are working _with_ the muscles that are already contracting involuntarily, not fighting to do all the work yourself

*Why this matters:*
- Pushing through an entire contraction means you are straining hard during the buildup and tail end, when your uterine muscles are doing relatively little — that is wasted effort
- Timing your push to the crest means shorter, more powerful pushes instead of long, exhausting ones
- Women who use this approach report significantly less fatigue during the pushing stage
- It aligns with the spontaneous pushing research: shorter pushes, better oxygenation for baby, less pelvic floor strain #citation[3]

This technique works best in unmedicated births where you can feel your contractions clearly. With an epidural, you may not be able to sense the crest, and some coached guidance from your team about contraction timing can substitute.

== OUR TAKE

This is a genuine decision with real trade-offs, and the right answer depends on your circumstances and preferences.

The strongest case for spontaneous pushing is the research on outcomes: studies consistently show better fetal oxygenation, lower rates of pelvic floor damage, and less maternal exhaustion when women push at their own pace #citation[3]. For unmedicated births, your body's built-in Ferguson reflex is a powerful, well-designed guide.

The strongest case for directed pushing is the structure it provides. First-time mothers often feel genuinely lost during the pushing stage, and clear coaching can be reassuring and confidence-building. When an epidural has dulled or eliminated the natural urge to push, directed guidance helps you work with your contractions even when you cannot feel them. In prolonged or complicated deliveries, coordinated pushing efforts guided by your care team can make a meaningful difference.

Women who value a less-interventional, body-led experience tend to lean toward spontaneous pushing. Women who value structured guidance, or who are planning an epidural, often appreciate some degree of coached pushing. Both are legitimate approaches, and many births use a blend of the two.

*If you prefer spontaneous pushing:* "I'd like to push following my own cues. Please let me find my rhythm before offering coaching."

*If you prefer directed pushing:* "I'd appreciate coaching during the pushing stage so I know what to do."

*With an epidural:* You may need some guidance since the urge to push can be reduced. Ask your team to let you know when contractions are happening, and discuss whether laboring down (waiting for baby to descend before active pushing) makes sense for your situation.

Whatever approach you choose, make sure your care team knows your preference ahead of time so they can support you the way you want to be supported.
