= Chapter 12: Circumcision: Making the Decision <ch-circumcision>

== One-Page Overview

Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the tissue covering the head of the penis. In the United States, approximately 50% of newborn boys are circumcised, though this rate has been declining. Outside the U.S., routine infant circumcision is uncommon in most developed countries.

The medical evidence shows some health benefits exist, but they are modest. Circumcision reduces urinary tract infections (though you would need to circumcise about 100 boys to prevent one UTI). Claims about HIV prevention come from studies in Africa and may not apply to developed countries. Penile cancer is so rare (less than 1 in 100,000 men) that prevention is not a practical benefit.

Risks include bleeding, infection, and pain. Serious complications are rare but documented. The procedure is painful and pain management varies widely between hospitals.

*Bottom line:* No major medical organization recommends routine circumcision for all newborns. No major medical organization says it should never be done. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) concluded that benefits outweigh risks, but not enough to recommend the procedure universally. The decision is left to parents based on their values, culture, religion, and individual circumstances.

== What Is Circumcision?

=== The Procedure

Circumcision is surgery to remove the foreskin, the retractable fold of skin that covers the head (glans) of the penis. It is typically performed in the hospital within the first few days of life and takes about 5-10 minutes.

Several methods are used:

- *Gomco clamp:* The foreskin is drawn through a bell-shaped device. A clamp cuts off blood flow, and the foreskin is trimmed away. This takes 3-5 minutes.
- *Mogen clamp:* A hinged clamp holds the foreskin while cutting. This is faster, usually 1-2 minutes.
- *Plastibell device:* A plastic ring is placed under the foreskin and a thread is tied around it, cutting off blood supply. The ring falls off in 5-8 days as the tissue separates.

=== What Tissue Is Removed

The foreskin is not a leftover piece of tissue or "extra skin." It is functional, specialized tissue that serves several purposes:

- *Protection:* The foreskin covers and protects the sensitive head of the penis during childhood and adulthood. The glans penis is anatomically an internal organ—similar to the clitoris in females—meant to remain covered and protected by the foreskin. When circumcision permanently exposes the glans, the tissue undergoes keratinization: a process where the normally moist, mucosal surface thickens and dries to protect itself from constant exposure to air, clothing, and friction. This is the body's protective response to having an internal organ made external.
- *Sensation:* The foreskin contains fine-touch receptors and specialized nerve endings. Studies show it is among the most sensitive parts of the external penis, with thousands of nerve endings concentrated in a small area of tissue.
- *Function during sex:* The foreskin moves during sexual activity, reducing friction. It also provides natural lubrication and gliding action. The gliding mechanism benefits both partners during intercourse: it allows the penis to move within its own sheath of skin rather than creating friction against vaginal tissue. This natural motion reduces the need for artificial lubrication and can enhance sensation for both the man and his partner. Research suggests the foreskin's mechanical function contributes to comfortable sexual activity without excessive friction.
- *Development:* In newborns, the foreskin is naturally fused to the head of the penis. This protects the developing tissue. The foreskin separates naturally over time, typically between ages 3-5.

=== Biblical vs. Modern Circumcision: An Important Distinction

Many people assume that biblical circumcision was the same procedure performed today. This is not accurate.

*Biblical circumcision (brit periah):*
- In ancient times, only the overhanging tip of the foreskin was removed
- This was a relatively minor procedure that removed a small amount of skin
- The glans (head) of the penis remained partially or mostly covered
- The procedure was less invasive and removed far less tissue

*Modern circumcision:*
- Completely removes the entire foreskin
- Fully exposes the glans (head) of the penis
- Removes approximately 50% of the penile skin
- Removes all of the specialized nerve tissue and fine-touch receptors in the foreskin
- Is a significantly more radical procedure than the ancient practice

*Historical evolution:* The practice evolved over centuries. During the Talmudic period (500-625 CE), the procedure became more extensive. By the Victorian era, when circumcision was adopted by Western medicine, it had become the complete removal we see today.

This distinction matters because parents making decisions based on religious tradition may not realize they are choosing a procedure that goes well beyond what was practiced in biblical times.

== Medical Organization Positions

=== AAP 2012 Position

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its most recent policy statement on circumcision in 2012. This statement is often misunderstood.

*What the AAP says:*
- The health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks
- The benefits justify insurance coverage for the procedure
- The AAP does _not_ recommend routine circumcision for all newborns

*What this actually means:* The AAP found that some health benefits exist, but benefits minus risks equals a small number. Small enough that the AAP decided not to recommend the procedure universally. Instead, they left the choice to parents.

Dr. Andrew Freedman, who served on the task force that wrote the policy, explained: "There's no right or wrong answer. There are some minimal benefits and some minimal risks. There's not enough benefit to say you must do it, and there's not enough risk to say you can never do it."

Important: This policy expired in 2017 and has not been updated. The 2012 statement remains the AAP's most recent guidance.

=== International Perspectives

Outside the United States, medical organizations take a different view:

- *Royal Dutch Medical Association (Netherlands):* Concluded there is "no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene." The organization opposes non-therapeutic circumcision in children.
- *Danish Medical Association:* Stated that "the current practice of circumcising boys without a medical indication should cease."
- *British Medical Association:* Noted that "parental preference alone does not constitute sufficient grounds" for circumcision and that evidence of health benefits is insufficient.
- *German pediatric organizations:* Multiple German medical associations oppose routine non-medical infant circumcision.

The key difference: American medicine focuses on potential disease prevention. European medicine focuses on whether diseases are actually common enough to justify the procedure. In countries with treatable UTIs and very rare penile cancer, routine circumcision is harder to justify medically.

*Key fact:* No major medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision for all male infants. No major medical organization recommends banning it. The procedure occupies a middle ground: it is an option, not a requirement.

== The Claimed Benefits

=== UTI Reduction: The Real Numbers

Urinary tract infection prevention is the most well-supported benefit.

*What the research shows:*
- Circumcision reduces UTI risk. Uncircumcised boys have about 10 times higher risk of UTI in infancy compared to circumcised boys.
- This protective effect decreases with age.

*But here are the real numbers:*
- To prevent one UTI in a healthy boy, you need to circumcise approximately 100-111 boys.
- To prevent one UTI serious enough to require hospitalization, about 195 boys need to be circumcised.
- Overall UTI risk in healthy uncircumcised boys is about 1-2% by age 5.
- UTIs in boys are almost always easily treated with antibiotics.

*When this matters more:* Boys with certain urological conditions benefit more from circumcision. For boys with recurrent UTIs, the number needed to treat drops to about 11. For boys with vesicoureteric reflux (urine backing up into kidneys), only about 4 circumcisions prevent one UTI.

=== HIV/STI Prevention: The African Studies and Their Limitations

Three major studies in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda found that circumcision reduced HIV infection rates in heterosexual men by about 60%. This led the World Health Organization to recommend voluntary medical male circumcision in high-prevalence African countries.

*Critical limitations:*
1. These studies were done in settings with extremely high HIV rates where heterosexual transmission is the main route of infection.
2. The procedure was performed on adolescents and adults who consented, not newborns.
3. There is no evidence that circumcision reduces transmission from men to women.
4. There is no evidence of protection for male-to-male transmission.
5. Population-level data from several African countries showed circumcised men were actually more likely to be HIV-positive than intact men.
6. Whether these findings apply to newborn circumcision in low-prevalence developed countries has not been established.

*For other STIs:* The evidence is weaker than for HIV.

=== Penile Cancer: Extremely Rare

Penile cancer is sometimes cited as a reason for circumcision.

*How rare is it?*
- Less than 1 case per 100,000 men per year in developed countries
- Less than 1% of all male cancers
- Average age at diagnosis: 60 years old

For comparison, prostate cancer affects 288,000 American men per year. Penile cancer affects fewer than 2,000.

Circumcision may provide some protection, but this appears to work mainly by preventing phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin), which is a risk factor for penile cancer. When studies looked only at men without phimosis, circumcision showed no protective effect.

=== Critical Analysis

When examining these benefits together:
- UTI prevention is real but modest (100 circumcisions to prevent one infection)
- HIV prevention data comes from a very different context and may not apply
- Penile cancer is too rare to be a meaningful factor
- Better alternatives exist for most claimed benefits (antibiotics for UTIs, condoms for STI prevention)

#line(length: 100%)

== The Risks and Considerations

=== Complication Rates

Circumcision is surgery, and all surgery carries risks.

*Overall complication rate: 1.5-3% in most studies* (though rates from 0-16% have been reported depending on how complications are counted)

*Common complications:*
- *Bleeding:* The most frequent complication. Usually minor and stops with gentle pressure. Occurs in about 0.5-2% of circumcisions.
- *Infection:* Usually minor and treatable with antibiotics. Occurs in about 0.5-1% of circumcisions.
- *Meatal stenosis:* Narrowing of the urethral opening, which may cause difficulty urinating. Occurs in about 0.3-1% of circumcisions.

*Serious complications (rare but documented):*
- Severe infection, including sepsis
- Excessive bleeding requiring intervention
- Hemorrhagic shock
- Septic shock
- Damage to the penis
- Death

=== Infant Deaths from Circumcision: The Underreported Reality

While death from circumcision is rare, it is not as rare as commonly stated. The actual number may be significantly underreported.

*Current estimates:*
- A 2010 analysis by Bollinger estimated approximately *117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths occur annually in the United States* (about 9.01 per 100,000 circumcisions)
- This represents about 1.3% of male neonatal deaths from all causes
- For comparison: 115 neonatal deaths from SIDS, 44 from suffocation, and 8 in automobile accidents during the same neonatal period
- A separate 2018 analysis (Earp et al.) found 1 death per 49,166 circumcisions over a 10-year period

*Why deaths may be underreported:*
- Many circumcision-related deaths are reported as "surgical mishap," "infection," "hemorrhage," "cardiac arrest," "stroke," or "reaction to anesthesia" rather than being directly attributed to circumcision
- The death may occur days after the procedure, making the connection less obvious
- There is no mandatory tracking system for circumcision complications and deaths in the United States

*Severe complications requiring hospitalization:*
- A Canadian study found that 19 previously healthy newborns were admitted for acute complications after circumcision over 14 years in one metropolitan area
- Seven were admitted to intensive care with severe bleeding or sepsis
- Three progressed to hemorrhagic or septic shock
- Eight boys required emergency surgery
- The researchers concluded: "The risk of serious complications and death as a result of neonatal circumcision is greater than generally assumed"

*Bleeding complications:*
- Even with modern techniques, bleeding occurs in more than 15% of cases
- Premature babies experience more than twice the rate of bleeding complications compared to full-term babies
- Undiagnosed bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease) can turn circumcision into a life-threatening emergency

*A critical fact:*
Because infant circumcision is elective (not medically necessary), all of these deaths are avoidable. When discussing risk, remember that the baseline risk for an intact penis is zero.

Complications are less likely when the provider is experienced, the procedure is done in a medical setting, and it is performed in the newborn period. However, serious complications and deaths do occur even with experienced providers in appropriate settings.

=== What the Foreskin Does

The foreskin is not useless tissue:
- It protects the sensitive head of the penis
- It contains specialized nerve endings for fine-touch sensation
- It moves during sexual activity, reducing friction
- In newborns, it is fused to the head of the penis to protect developing tissue

=== Sensitivity Research and Reports from Men Circumcised as Adults

Research on whether circumcision affects sexual sensation is mixed and contested. However, one unique source of insight comes from men who were circumcised as adults—men who have experienced sex both with and without a foreskin.

*Studies finding reduced sensitivity and pleasure:*
- A large 2013 cohort study found that circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity for the glans penis
- A higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort, pain, and unusual sensations compared to uncircumcised men
- In one study of men circumcised as adults, masturbatory pleasure decreased in 48% of respondents (only 8% reported increased pleasure)
- Masturbatory difficulty increased in 63% of respondents after circumcision
- About 20% reported a worse sex life after circumcision, while only 6% reported improvement
- Men circumcised after age 10 reported lower sexual pleasure and greater discomfort

*Studies finding no adverse effects or improvements:*
- A 2013 systematic review of 40,473 men found no overall adverse effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, erectile function, or orgasm
- Some studies found that circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm
- High-quality studies uniformly found minimal or no adverse effect on sexual function

*Why the contradiction?*
- Study methods vary dramatically
- Studies in Europe often involve men circumcised to treat medical conditions (phimosis, balanitis, lichen sclerosus), which may have already affected sexual function
- Studies in Africa examined circumcision for HIV prevention in settings with different cultural contexts
- How people feel about their circumcision status may influence their reported satisfaction
- The timing of circumcision (infant vs. adult) affects what men can report

*What men circumcised as adults report:*
Men who were circumcised in adulthood—who can directly compare the experience—commonly report reduced sexual pleasure and sensation. While not universal, this is a consistent finding across multiple studies. These men can speak from direct experience about what was lost.

*The honest assessment:*
Circumcision removes specialized nerve tissue and fine-touch receptors. The foreskin is not "extra" tissue—it is functional sensory tissue. Whether this loss significantly affects sexual satisfaction appears to vary by individual, but the anatomical reality is that sensitive tissue is permanently removed.

=== Pain Management

Circumcision causes significant pain. Studies show the procedure increases heart rate, stress hormones, and blood pressure. Some babies cry intensely; others go into a shutdown state.

*Pain management varies widely:*
- Some hospitals routinely offer local anesthetic
- Others offer it only if parents request it
- Some do not offer any pain relief

When pain management is used, it typically includes:
- Dorsal penile nerve block (injection near the base of the penis)
- Ring block (injection around the penis)
- Topical anesthetic cream (less effective than injection)
- Sucrose or other comfort measures

Even with anesthesia, pain is reduced but not eliminated.

=== The Trauma Question: Early Life Pain and Development

This is a difficult topic, but one that deserves honest discussion.

*What happens physiologically during circumcision:*
- Cortisol (stress hormone) levels elevate 3-4x and remain elevated for hours to days afterward
- Heart rate and blood pressure increase significantly
- Researchers have documented decreased wakefulness, increased vagal tone, and reduced environmental interaction following the procedure

*Research on altered pain processing:*
A study comparing circumcised and uncircumcised infants found that circumcised boys showed significantly stronger pain responses to routine vaccinations months later. The researchers suggested this represents an "infant analogue" of altered stress response—the early pain experience changed how their nervous systems process subsequent pain.

*The first hours and days matter:*
Research published in _Frontiers in Pediatrics_ shows that the developing brain is particularly sensitive to procedural pain during a "critical window" in early life. The brain regions most affected are those connected to the limbic system—the areas governing emotion, memory, and stress response.

While we cannot ask a newborn how they experience circumcision, we can measure their physiological responses. Those responses indicate significant stress. Whether this constitutes "trauma" in the psychological sense, and whether it has lasting effects, remains debated.

*Studies with conflicting findings:*

_Studies suggesting long-term effects:_
- A study of 408 circumcised and 211 non-circumcised men found that early-circumcised men reported lower attachment security and lower emotional stability
- Research by Ramos and Boyle found that 51% of boys circumcised in a hospital setting met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, though this study has methodological limitations

_Studies finding no long-term effects:_
- Other studies have found no statistically significant differences in psychological measures between circumcised and intact men
- Many circumcised men report no negative psychological effects

*The honest assessment:*
The research is mixed and methodologically challenging. What we can say with confidence:
1. Circumcision is painful and stressful for infants
2. Early life pain can affect developing brain regions and pain processing
3. Whether circumcision specifically causes lasting psychological harm is not definitively established
4. The experience varies based on pain management, individual infant, and circumstances

*What this means for your decision:*
If you choose circumcision, ensure adequate pain management is provided. The procedure should not be performed without anesthesia. Consider timing (day 8 may be optimal). Understand that your baby will experience pain and stress, even with pain relief.

If you're uncertain whether the medical benefits justify subjecting your newborn to a painful surgical procedure in his first days of life, that uncertainty is reasonable. Many parents conclude the answer is no.

== Cultural and Religious Considerations

=== Jewish Tradition (Day 8, Vitamin K)

In Jewish tradition, circumcision (brit milah, or "bris") is performed on the 8th day of life by a trained circumciser called a mohel.

*Why day 8 matters medically:* By day 8, an infant's blood clotting ability has naturally peaked. Vitamin K levels rise after birth and reach their highest point around day 8. Clotting factors reach and exceed adult levels. This reduces bleeding risk.

This is remarkable: the ancient tradition essentially identified the optimal timing for blood clotting without modern medical knowledge.

Jewish law allows postponement if the baby is ill, and specifies that if two brothers died from circumcision complications, the third brother should not be circumcised. This guidance is consistent with concern about hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disorder.

Traditional brit milah involves minimal pain management, though many modern mohelim now use anesthesia.

=== Muslim Tradition

In Islam, circumcision (khitan) is considered important but is not mandated in the Quran. It appears in hadith (reports of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings) and is viewed as highly recommended.

Timing varies widely: days after birth, around age 6-7, or later childhood. There is no single standard across Muslim communities.

=== American Cultural Norms: The Anti-Masturbation Origins

In the United States, circumcision became a cultural norm in the 20th century for non-religious reasons. Understanding this history provides important context for decision-making.

*The Victorian anti-masturbation crusade:*
- In the late 1800s and early 1900s, American medical leaders believed masturbation was the underlying cause of nearly all social problems and diseases
- Circumcision was promoted as a way to reduce sexual pleasure and make masturbation more difficult
- The procedure was advertised as a "cure" for self-abuse, which was viewed as both morally wrong and medically harmful
- This occurred within a highly religious Victorian environment where Christianity heavily influenced medical practice

*Key figures and their motivations:*
- *John Kellogg* (founder of Kellogg's cereal) viewed circumcision as "an effective cure for masturbation and the social ills said to accompany it." He also created cornflakes as part of an anti-masturbation diet.
- *Sylvester Graham* (creator of graham crackers) was a former preacher who brought the subject of masturbation to wide public notice and promoted dietary and surgical interventions
- *Jonathan Hutchinson* contended that the foreskin "conduces to masturbation, and adds to the difficulties of sexual continence"
- *Abraham Wolbarst* argued in 1914 that circumcision should be made compulsory as a means of reducing masturbation

*Medical claims throughout the early 20th century:*
- Physicians promoted circumcision as a treatment for tuberculosis, epilepsy, paralysis, hip pain, insanity, hysteria, and neurasthenia
- These claims were not based on scientific evidence but on moral and religious beliefs about sexuality
- Mainstream pediatric manuals continued to recommend circumcision as a deterrent against masturbation until the 1950s
- As late as 1970, a standard U.S. urology textbook said "Parents readily adopt measures which may avert masturbation. Circumcision is usually advised on these grounds"

*How the practice became routine:*
- In 1900, fewer than 5% of American boys were circumcised
- By 1925, approximately 55% were circumcised
- By 1970, about 80-90% were circumcised
- This shift was driven by pseudo-medical claims rooted in religious and moral reform movements, not by scientific evidence

The historical context reveals that routine newborn circumcision in America has its roots in discredited beliefs about masturbation and Victorian-era sexual morality, not in legitimate medical necessity. While modern justifications focus on potential health benefits, the practice became culturally entrenched for very different reasons.

=== Declining Rates

Circumcision rates are falling:
- Current U.S. rate: approximately 50% (down from 80-90% in the 1970s)
- Western states: 30-40%
- Midwest and South: 60-70%
- Rates are lower among Hispanic and Asian American families

For families without religious or cultural reasons, the trend is toward leaving infants intact.

=== Global Perspective: Your Son Won't Be "Different"

A common concern American parents have is that an uncircumcised son will feel "different" or unusual. The global data tells a very different story.

*Worldwide circumcision rates:*
- Approximately 30-38% of males worldwide are circumcised
- This means roughly 62-70% of males globally are intact (uncircumcised)
- The United States is an outlier among developed nations

*Countries where most males are uncircumcised:*
- Europe: 5-20% circumcised (80-95% intact)
- Latin America: Less than 1% circumcised
- Most of Asia: 5-15% circumcised
- Australia: 27% circumcised (73% intact)
- Canada: Declining rates, varies by province

*Specific country rates:*
- Sweden: 5% circumcised
- Germany: 11% circumcised
- France: 14% circumcised
- UK: 20.7% circumcised
- Japan: 9% circumcised
- China: 14% circumcised
- India: 13.5% circumcised

*Countries with high circumcision rates:*
- Middle East and North Africa: 90-100% (primarily for religious reasons)
- Parts of Africa: 60-90% (mix of religious tradition and HIV prevention programs)
- Israel: 92% (religious requirement)
- United States: approximately 50% (cultural practice, declining)

*What this means for your decision:*
Most males in the world are uncircumcised. If your family travels, lives internationally, or your son grows up in an increasingly globalized world, being intact is the norm, not the exception. Even within the U.S., rates are declining and vary dramatically by region. The "everyone else is doing it" argument no longer holds up, if it ever did.

#line(length: 100%)

== Ethical Considerations

=== Bodily Autonomy

The central ethical tension is between parental rights and the child's right to bodily integrity.

*The parental authority view:* Parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children. This authority is grounded in the assumption that parents act in their child's best interests.

*The bodily autonomy view:* Many ethicists argue that:
- Circumcision is an irreversible surgical alteration of a healthy child who cannot consent
- The procedure is not medically necessary to save the child's life or treat a disease
- The decision could be deferred until the child is old enough to decide for himself

Several medical organizations have taken positions emphasizing the child's right to bodily integrity:
- The Swedish Medical Association recommended setting 12 as the minimum age and requiring the child's consent
- The Danish Medical Association emphasized the child's right to self-determination
- A German court ruled in 2012 that circumcision of a non-consenting boy constitutes assault, even for religious reasons (this sparked international debate)

=== Irreversibility

Unlike many medical decisions, circumcision is permanent:
- The foreskin cannot be regrown
- Any change to sensation is permanent
- The altered anatomy is permanent

Some ethicists argue that medical procedures on children should meet this standard: "Would the child likely choose this for himself as an adult?" For most medical decisions (vaccines, treating infections, setting broken bones), the answer is clearly yes. For circumcision without religious reasons, the answer is less clear.

#line(length: 100%)

== Making Your Decision

=== If You Choose Circumcision

*Timing:*
- Day 8 is considered optimal (aligns with peak blood clotting and Jewish tradition)
- Days 1-3 are acceptable but clotting has not yet peaked
- The newborn period (first 1-2 weeks) is considered safest
- Waiting past the newborn period is possible but more complicated

*Pain management - ask for it explicitly:*
- Request a local anesthetic
- Dorsal penile nerve block or ring block is most effective
- If your provider does not offer anesthesia, ask why and consider another provider
- Even with anesthesia, comfort measures (holding, sugar water) help

*Provider selection:*
- Ask about your provider's experience and complication rate
- If using a religious circumciser, ask about training and pain management
- Verify the procedure will be performed in a sterile environment

*Aftercare:*
- Follow your provider's specific instructions
- Change diapers frequently to keep the area clean and dry
- Gently clean with warm water
- Apply any prescribed ointment
- Contact a doctor for excessive bleeding, signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, fever), or inability to urinate

=== If You Decline: Care of the Intact Penis

Caring for an uncircumcised penis is actually simpler than caring for a circumcised one.

*Newborn care:*
- Wash with warm water only (no soap, no cotton swabs)
- The foreskin is fused to the head and will not retract. This is normal.
- *Never force the foreskin back*
- Clean only what is visible

*What is normal:*
- The foreskin will not retract in infancy
- A white or yellowish substance (smegma) under the foreskin is normal and protective
- Small pearl-like bumps under the foreskin are normal

*As your child grows (ages 1-5):*
- The foreskin gradually separates naturally
- This happens at different ages (can take years)
- Never force retraction
- Care stays the same: warm water only

*When the foreskin is fully retractable (usually age 3-5 or later):*
- Teach your son to gently pull back the foreskin and rinse with warm water during baths
- This becomes a normal part of hygiene, similar to how girls are taught to wipe

*The rule is simple:* "If intact, do not retract. Only clean what is seen."

*About phimosis:* Many parents worry about this. True phimosis (inability to retract that causes symptoms) occurs in only 1-2% of boys. If it does develop, first-line treatment is topical corticosteroid cream, which works in 75-90% of cases. Circumcision is not needed as prevention.

#line(length: 100%)

== Our Take

Circumcision is a personal decision that should be made thoughtfully, not automatically.

The medical evidence does not strongly support routine circumcision. The benefits are real but modest. The risks are usually minor but real. No major medical organization recommends the procedure for all newborns.

For families with religious or cultural traditions around circumcision, those traditions are valid reasons to proceed. For families without such traditions, the medical case alone is not compelling enough to recommend the procedure.

If you choose circumcision, ensure your baby receives adequate pain management and choose an experienced provider. If you choose not to circumcise, know that caring for an intact penis is straightforward.

Either choice is reasonable. What matters is that you understand the evidence, consider your values, and make an informed decision for your family.
