= VBAC: Vaginal Birth After Cesarean <ch-vbac>

If you have had a previous cesarean, you have more options than you may realize. Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is successful for the majority of women who attempt it, yet only about 14% of eligible women in the U.S. get to try. This guide explains what the research actually shows about VBAC, helps you find supportive care, and empowers you to make an informed decision.

#line(length: 100%)

== One-Page Overview

_Quick Summary:_
- VBAC success rate is 60-80% for most women with one prior cesarean [1]
- Uterine rupture risk is 0.5-0.7% (less than 1 in 100) with proper screening [2]
- VBAC offers faster recovery, lower infection risk, and avoids cumulative surgical risks [1]
- "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" is an outdated 1916 statement that no longer applies [3]
- Finding a VBAC-supportive provider is critical, as support varies enormously between hospitals
- Spontaneous labor has higher success rates than induction (79% vs 66%) [1]

_Bottom Line:_ For most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean, VBAC should be the default recommendation. The success rates are excellent, the risks are low, and the benefits are substantial for both mother and baby.

== What Is VBAC?

_VBAC stands for Vaginal Birth After Cesarean._ It means having a vaginal delivery in a pregnancy that follows a previous cesarean birth.

_TOLAC stands for Trial of Labor After Cesarean._ This is the process of attempting vaginal birth after a previous cesarean. If you succeed, you have had a VBAC. If you need another cesarean during labor, you have had a TOLAC but not a VBAC.

_The difference matters:_ When you hear success rates for VBAC, they are measuring the percentage of women who attempt TOLAC and deliver vaginally. A 75% VBAC success rate means 75 out of 100 women who try for vaginal birth achieve it, while 25 need a repeat cesarean.

== The History: "Once a Cesarean, Always a Cesarean"

In 1916, physician Edwin Cragin spoke these words to the New York Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" [3,4]. Through the following 50-60 years, this statement reflected most U.S. obstetricians' management of patients with prior cesarean delivery.

_Why was this the rule?_

Cragin was speaking in an era when cesareans were performed with a classical (vertical) incision through the upper part of the uterus. This type of incision had a high risk of rupture in subsequent pregnancies. His warning made sense for the surgical technique of his time.

_What changed:_

In 1926, surgeon Munro Kerr introduced the low transverse incision, a horizontal cut made across the lower, thinner part of the uterus [3]. This became the standard technique and is now used in approximately 90% of cesareans today.

The low transverse incision is far more stable. It heals stronger and is much less likely to rupture in future pregnancies. Once this technique became standard, the medical justification for "once a cesarean, always a cesarean" disappeared.

_The modern era:_

Starting in the 1980s, research began establishing the safety of VBAC. A growing body of evidence showed that most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean could safely deliver vaginally. By the 1990s, VBAC was actively encouraged.

Then in 1999, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued stricter guidelines requiring that anesthesia be "immediately available" for VBAC attempts. Many hospitals interpreted this to mean 24/7 surgical teams on standby, which effectively eliminated VBAC access at smaller and rural hospitals. The VBAC rate plummeted.

_Where we are now:_

Current ACOG guidelines support VBAC for most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean. The evidence is clear that VBAC is safe and beneficial. However, access remains limited due to hospital policies, provider concerns about liability, and outdated attitudes that persist despite the research.

== VBAC Success Rates

_Overall success rate: 60-80%_

When women attempt VBAC, most succeed. Your individual chances depend on several factors.

_Factors that increase your likelihood of successful VBAC:_

_Strong predictors of success:_
- _Previous vaginal birth:_ Particularly powerful. If you have ever delivered vaginally (either before or after your cesarean), your VBAC success rate jumps to approximately 85-90%
- _Spontaneous labor:_ Women who go into labor naturally have 79% success, compared to 66% with induction
- _Non-recurring reason for previous cesarean:_ If your cesarean was for breech position, placenta previa, or another reason that does not apply this time, your odds improve significantly
- _Normal BMI:_ Women with BMI under 30 have higher success rates
- _Younger maternal age:_ Success rates are higher for women under 35
- _Shorter interval between pregnancies (but not too short):_ At least 18 months but less than 5 years appears optimal

_What decreases success rates:_
- Induction of labor (particularly with an unfavorable cervix)
- Advanced gestational age (over 40 weeks)
- Maternal obesity (BMI over 30)
- Maternal age over 35
- Previous cesarean for "failure to progress" or labor arrest
- Estimated fetal weight over 4,000 grams (though size estimates are often inaccurate)

_VBAC calculators:_

Several tools exist to predict your individual likelihood of VBAC success. The most widely used is the #link("https://mfmunetwork.bsc.gwu.edu/PublicBSC/MFMU/VGBirthCalc/vagbirth.html")[Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network calculator], which considers factors like your age, BMI, previous vaginal delivery, and reason for prior cesarean.

_Important limitations of VBAC calculators:_

Research shows that VBAC calculators may overestimate success rates, particularly for induced labor [5]. Studies have found significant gaps between predicted and actual success rates when induction is involved, suggesting the calculator does not adequately account for how induction affects VBAC outcomes [5]. The calculator does not distinguish between spontaneous labor and induction, which significantly affects outcomes.

Additionally, earlier versions of VBAC calculators included race as a biological variable, which has been criticized as introducing racial bias [7]. Updated versions have replaced this with clinical factors like chronic hypertension.

_The bottom line:_ VBAC calculators provide useful information but should not be used as a barrier to TOLAC. Your score should inform counseling, not determine eligibility. Many women with "low" predicted scores still achieve VBAC.

== The Evidence: Benefits vs. Risks

=== Benefits of VBAC (Compared to Repeat Cesarean)

_For your recovery:_
- Faster return to normal activities: 2-4 weeks versus 6-8 weeks
- Less pain and shorter hospital stay
- Lower risk of infection (1% versus 3-5%)
- No surgical wound to heal
- Easier care for other children at home

_For this pregnancy:_
- Lower blood loss: 200-500 mL average versus 500-1,000 mL
- Reduced risk of blood clots: 5-13 times lower than cesarean
- Lower risk of requiring blood transfusion
- Similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes overall
- Earlier breastfeeding initiation and better early nursing success

_For future pregnancies:_
- Avoids cumulative risks of multiple surgeries
- No additional scar tissue formation (adhesions)
- Lower risk of placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies
- Lower risk of placenta accreta (placenta growing into the uterine wall)
- Preserves your options for future births

_For your baby:_
- Exposure to beneficial vaginal bacteria that seed the microbiome
- Lower rates of respiratory problems at birth
- Hormonal benefits from experiencing labor

_Long-term implications:_

Each cesarean increases your risk of serious complications in future pregnancies. Adhesion rates (internal scar tissue) increase dramatically:
- After 1st cesarean: 7%
- After 2nd cesarean: 24-46%
- After 3rd cesarean: 43-75%
- After 4th cesarean: 83%

If you plan to have more children, avoiding additional cesareans protects your future reproductive health.

=== Primary Risk: Uterine Rupture

_What is uterine rupture?_

Uterine rupture occurs when the scar from your previous cesarean opens during labor. This is different from uterine dehiscence, which is a partial or incomplete separation that typically causes no symptoms and is discovered incidentally during surgery.

True uterine rupture requires emergency intervention but is uncommon and usually recognized quickly.

_Actual numbers:_

- Risk with TOLAC (low transverse incision): 0.5-0.7% (1 in 143-200) [2]
- Risk with planned repeat cesarean: 0.02-0.03% (1 in 3,300-5,000) [2]
- Risk with low vertical incision: 2% [2]
- Risk with classical (vertical upper uterine) incision: 1.9-10.6% [2]

_Factors that increase rupture risk:_

- Classical or T-shaped incision from previous cesarean
- Labor induction or augmentation (particularly with prostaglandins)
- Previous uterine rupture
- Interval less than 18 months since previous cesarean
- Multiple prior cesareans (1.36% with two prior cesareans)

_Factors that do NOT increase rupture risk significantly:_

- Large baby
- Twins (though many providers will not offer TOLAC for twins)
- Going past your due date
- Maternal age

_What happens if rupture occurs:_

Uterine rupture is serious but usually not catastrophic when it occurs in a hospital setting. The most common warning sign is abnormal fetal heart rate patterns (seen in up to 70% of cases). When recognized promptly and treated with emergency cesarean, outcomes are generally good.

Maternal complications from uterine rupture can include significant bleeding requiring transfusion and, rarely, hysterectomy. Serious harm to the baby is uncommon when the rupture is recognized and treated quickly.

_Putting the numbers in perspective:_

Your risk of uterine rupture during TOLAC (0.5-0.7%) is:
- Lower than the risk of placenta accreta after multiple cesareans (3-5%)
- Comparable to many other accepted pregnancy risks
- Significantly lower than the cumulative risks of multiple cesarean deliveries if you plan more children

=== Comparing Overall Outcomes

Multiple studies have compared maternal and neonatal outcomes between VBAC and planned repeat cesarean:

_Maternal outcomes:_ VBAC generally results in similar or better outcomes, including lower maternal mortality, fewer infections, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays.

_Neonatal outcomes:_ Overall perinatal outcomes are similar between TOLAC and planned repeat cesarean when TOLAC is attempted in appropriate candidates at facilities with emergency cesarean capability.

_The evidence supports VBAC_ as a safe and often preferable option for most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean.

#line(length: 100%)

== Finding a VBAC-Supportive Provider

Your choice of provider and hospital may be the single most important factor in whether you get to attempt VBAC and whether you succeed.

_The access problem:_

Despite 60-80% success rates and strong safety evidence, only about 14% of eligible women in the U.S. attempt VBAC. This is not because women do not want to try; it is because many providers and hospitals do not offer it.

_Why VBAC access is limited:_

- Hospital policies that ban or severely restrict TOLAC
- Malpractice concerns (providers face more liability for uterine rupture than for unnecessary cesarean)
- ACOG's "immediately available" anesthesia requirement, which many hospitals cannot meet
- Financial incentives (cesareans are more profitable and faster)
- Provider comfort and training (many newer obstetricians have limited VBAC experience)

=== Questions to Ask Potential Providers

_About their practice:_
1. "Do you support trial of labor after cesarean?"
2. "What percentage of your patients with prior cesarean attempt VBAC?"
3. "What are your personal VBAC success rates?"
4. "Under what circumstances would you recommend repeat cesarean instead of TOLAC?"
5. "How do you approach cervical ripening or induction for TOLAC patients?"

_About hospital policies:_
6. "What are this hospital's VBAC policies and success rates?"
7. "Is continuous fetal monitoring required during TOLAC?"
8. "Can I eat and drink during labor?"
9. "Can I use intermittent monitoring if I want to labor in water or move freely?"
10. "How quickly can you perform an emergency cesarean if needed?"

_About labor management:_
11. "Will you support spontaneous labor, or would you recommend scheduled induction?"
12. "Do you place time limits on labor for TOLAC patients?"
13. "How do you define 'failure to progress' in TOLAC?"
14. "Can I have a doula present?"

=== Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs that a provider may not truly support VBAC:

- _Discouraging language:_ "We allow VBAC, but..." or emphasis on worst-case scenarios without balanced discussion of risks and benefits
- _Blanket restrictions:_ Automatic exclusions for factors like maternal age, estimated baby size, or previous "failure to progress" without individualized assessment
- _Low TOLAC rates:_ If fewer than 30-40% of eligible patients attempt VBAC, the provider may not be truly supportive
- _Pressure tactics:_ Pushing scheduled cesarean without discussing VBAC as an option
- _Rigid time limits:_ Insisting labor must progress on a strict timeline or that you must deliver by a certain date
- _Routine early induction:_ Recommending induction before 40 weeks without clear medical indication

=== Hospital vs. Birth Center vs. Home Birth for VBAC

_Hospital birth:_

Most VBAC attempts occur in hospitals. ACOG recommends that TOLAC take place in facilities with immediate access to emergency cesarean and neonatal resuscitation.

_Advantages:_
- Immediate surgical capability if complications arise
- Continuous fetal monitoring available
- Access to anesthesia and blood products

_Disadvantages:_
- More restrictive policies (continuous monitoring, IV access, time limits)
- Higher intervention rates
- Less freedom to move and use comfort measures
- May be pressured toward unnecessary cesarean

_Birth center:_

Many birth centers exclude VBAC due to ACOG guidelines requiring immediate surgical access. However, some freestanding birth centers do accept TOLAC patients with appropriate screening and transfer agreements.

_Advantages:_
- Lower intervention rates
- More freedom during labor
- Midwifery model of care
- Home-like environment

_Disadvantages:_
- Not all centers accept VBAC patients
- Transfer required if cesarean becomes necessary
- May not have continuous monitoring

_Home birth:_

Home Birth After Cesarean (HBAC) is chosen by some women, particularly those who cannot find supportive hospital care or who had traumatic previous birth experiences.

_Research on HBAC:_

Studies show that planned HBAC with qualified midwives results in VBAC success rates of 87% or higher, substantially better than hospital rates [8]. A 2021 Canadian study found that planned HBAC was associated with a 39% decrease in the odds of cesarean birth compared to planned hospital VBAC, and severe adverse outcomes were relatively rare in both settings [8].

_Important considerations:_

- Emergency help is delayed if complications arise
- Continuous fetal monitoring (the most common early sign of uterine rupture) is not available
- Transfer to hospital required if cesarean becomes necessary
- Access depends on state laws and availability of midwives willing to attend HBAC
- Not supported by ACOG guidelines

_Who chooses HBAC:_

Women who plan HBAC typically fall into two groups: those who cannot find supportive hospital VBAC care in their area, and those who believe the benefits of physiologic birth (avoiding interventions that may lead to repeat cesarean) outweigh the risks of delayed emergency access.

_Making the decision:_

Your birth setting choice depends on:
- Your individual risk factors
- Access to VBAC-supportive hospital care in your area
- Your values and comfort with different risk/benefit tradeoffs
- Your previous birth experience
- Distance to hospital if transferring from home or birth center

_Consider a CNM (certified nurse-midwife):_ Some CNMs are experienced with and supportive of VBAC, particularly those with hospital privileges. They bring a midwifery philosophy of patience and physiologic birth into the hospital setting, which can support VBAC success. That said, VBAC support varies widely among individual providers regardless of credential type—always ask specific questions about their VBAC experience and rates.

_Finding support:_

- _ICAN (International Cesarean Awareness Network):_ ican-online.org provides chapter locations, provider lists, and support groups
- _Local birth doulas:_ Often know which providers and hospitals are truly VBAC-supportive
- _VBAC Facts:_ #link("https://vbacfacts.com")[vbacfacts.com] offers evidence-based information and resources
- _Online groups:_ VBAC support groups on social media can connect you with others in your area

== VBAC Restrictions: Evidence vs. Hospital Policy

Many hospitals impose restrictions on TOLAC that go beyond what evidence supports. Understanding the difference between research-based precautions and institutional policy helps you advocate for evidence-based care.

=== Continuous Fetal Monitoring

_What hospitals require:_ Most hospitals mandate continuous electronic fetal monitoring throughout labor for all TOLAC patients.

_What the evidence shows:_ ACOG states there is "limited or inconsistent scientific evidence" for continuous fetal heart rate monitoring during TOLAC. However, they acknowledge that abnormal fetal heart rate patterns are the most common early warning sign of uterine rupture (occurring in up to 70% of cases).

_The tradeoff:_ Continuous monitoring may help detect uterine rupture earlier, but it also restricts movement, limits comfort positions, and increases intervention rates. Intermittent auscultation (checking the baby's heart rate every 15-30 minutes with a handheld doppler) may be a reasonable alternative for low-risk TOLAC in some settings, but this is rarely offered.

Many hospitals now offer cordless or mobile continuous monitoring, allowing women to wear the monitor while moving freely. This can be a good middle ground — maintaining the early-warning benefit of continuous monitoring without being tethered to a bed. Ask your hospital whether wireless monitoring is available for TOLAC patients.

=== Time Limits on Labor

_What hospitals require:_ Many facilities impose strict time limits on TOLAC, such as "You must be in active labor within X hours" or "You must deliver within 24 hours of membrane rupture."

_What the evidence shows:_ TOLAC patients should be given adequate time for labor to progress naturally. While prolonged labor may decrease VBAC success rates, arbitrary time limits lead to unnecessary cesareans. The key is assessing whether labor is progressing appropriately for that individual, not adhering to rigid timelines.

=== Avoiding Induction

_What you may hear:_ "We cannot induce labor for VBAC" or "Induction is too risky with a prior cesarean."

_What the evidence shows:_ Labor induction does increase the risk of uterine rupture and decreases VBAC success rates, particularly when prostaglandins are used for cervical ripening. However, induction is not absolutely contraindicated.

_The nuance:_
- Prostaglandins (like misoprostol/Cytotec) significantly increase rupture risk and should be avoided
- Mechanical methods (like Foley balloon) appear safer
- Oxytocin (Pitocin) after spontaneous labor begins carries minimal additional risk
- If induction is being considered, the medical indication matters; elective induction decreases VBAC success significantly

_Recommendation:_ Whenever possible, wait for spontaneous labor. If induction is medically indicated, discuss methods carefully with your provider and understand that your VBAC success rate may be lower.

=== "VBAC Bans"

_The problem:_ Some hospitals, particularly smaller and rural facilities, do not offer TOLAC at all. This forces women to choose between repeat cesarean at their local hospital or traveling to a facility that supports VBAC.

_Why this happens:_ The 1999 ACOG requirement that anesthesia be "immediately available" has been interpreted to mean 24/7 in-house anesthesia coverage. Many smaller hospitals cannot meet this requirement.

_Your options if VBAC is not available locally:_
- Travel to a hospital that supports TOLAC (plan for earlier hospital admission to account for travel time)
- Seek care with a midwife at a birth center or home birth, if available and you are comfortable with this option
- Advocate with your local hospital to review their VBAC policy
- Consider whether a planned repeat cesarean may be your best option given the constraints

=== Other Common Restrictions

_Required IV access:_ Many hospitals require continuous IV or at minimum a hep-lock (IV catheter without fluids running). This is to ensure quick access in case of emergency, though it is not evidence-based and restricts movement.

_No food or drink:_ Despite evidence supporting eating and drinking in labor, many hospitals prohibit this for TOLAC patients. Ask specifically about this policy.

_Prohibition on water labor:_ Many facilities do not allow TOLAC patients to labor in water due to monitoring restrictions.

_Limitations on movement and position:_ Continuous monitoring may limit your ability to walk, change positions, or use gravity to help labor progress.

#line(length: 100%)

== Maximizing Your Chances of VBAC Success

While you cannot control everything about labor, certain strategies increase your likelihood of achieving VBAC.

_1. Choose a VBAC-supportive provider and setting_

This is the most important factor within your control. A provider with high VBAC rates and evidence-based practices dramatically improves your odds.

_2. Avoid induction if possible_

Spontaneous labor gives you a 79% success rate versus 66% with induction. Unless there is a clear medical reason to induce, waiting for natural labor onset maximizes your chances.

If induction is necessary:
- Ask about cervical readiness (Bishop score)
- Prefer mechanical methods over prostaglandins
- Understand that your success rate may be lower

_3. Hire a doula_

Continuous labor support from a trained doula is associated with:
- Lower cesarean rates overall
- Higher VBAC success rates
- Less need for pain medication
- More positive birth experience

A doula experienced with VBAC can provide encouragement, comfort measures, and advocacy when you need it most.

_4. Wait to go to the hospital_

Early hospital admission is associated with higher intervention rates. Unless you have complications or concerns, labor at home during early labor. Aim to arrive at the hospital when contractions are strong, regular, and close together.

_5. Stay mobile and use upright positions_

Movement and position changes help your baby navigate the pelvis and keep labor progressing. Even with continuous monitoring, you can often change positions in bed or stand beside it.

_6. Use non-pharmacological comfort measures_

Techniques like hydrotherapy (shower or bath if allowed), massage, breathing patterns, and position changes can help you cope with labor and avoid early epidural, which may slow labor progress.

_7. Be patient with early labor_

Many repeat cesareans happen because providers diagnose "failure to progress" too early. True active labor begins around 6 cm dilation. If your cervix is changing and baby is tolerating labor well, you deserve adequate time.

_8. Consider declining unnecessary interventions_

Each intervention can cascade into others:
- Early epidural may slow labor, leading to Pitocin
- Continuous IV fluids may limit mobility
- Artificial rupture of membranes may start the clock on "allowable" labor time

Ask about the medical indication for each intervention and whether it is truly necessary.

_9. Prepare mentally and emotionally_

VBAC is as much emotional as physical. Address any trauma from your previous birth. Consider therapy or VBAC support groups if you carry fear or anxiety. Visualization, affirmations, and positive birth stories can help prepare your mind.

_10. Have a backup plan_

Even with optimal conditions, about 20-40% of TOLAC attempts result in repeat cesarean. Make peace with this possibility. Prepare for both outcomes so you are not devastated if cesarean becomes necessary.

#line(length: 100%)

== When Repeat Cesarean May Be Recommended

VBAC is not appropriate for everyone. Understanding when repeat cesarean is genuinely the safer choice helps you make informed decisions.

=== Clear Contraindications to TOLAC

_Classical (vertical) uterine incision:_

If your previous cesarean involved a vertical cut through the upper part of your uterus, the rupture risk is significantly higher (1.9-10.6%). Planned repeat cesarean is typically recommended.

_How to know what type of incision you had:_
- Check your operative report from your previous cesarean (request records from the hospital)
- The skin incision (horizontal or vertical) does not tell you about the uterine incision
- Most cesareans use low-transverse uterine incisions, but classical incisions are sometimes performed for very preterm deliveries, certain placenta positions, or emergency situations

_Previous uterine rupture:_

If you experienced uterine rupture in a previous pregnancy, TOLAC is generally not recommended due to high recurrence risk.

_T-shaped or inverted-J incision:_

These incision types extend into the upper uterine segment and carry higher rupture risk (approximately 1.9%). Repeat cesarean is usually recommended.

_Extensive transfundal uterine surgery:_

If you have had surgery involving the upper part of your uterus (such as removal of large fibroids from that area), TOLAC may not be safe.

_Other contraindications to vaginal birth:_

Any condition that makes vaginal delivery unsafe (placenta previa, vasa previa, active herpes outbreak, certain maternal heart conditions) also contraindicates TOLAC.

=== Relative Contraindications (Situations Requiring Careful Discussion)

_Multiple prior cesareans:_

With two prior low-transverse cesareans, VBAC is still possible for many women. Success rates drop to about 50-72%, and uterine rupture risk increases to about 1.36%. ACOG states "it is reasonable to consider TOLAC" in these cases with appropriate counseling.

With three or more prior cesareans, data is limited, and most providers recommend repeat cesarean.

_Short interval since previous cesarean:_

Less than 18 months between deliveries increases uterine rupture risk to about 2%. If you are in this situation, discuss the specific risks with your provider.

_Unknown uterine scar type:_

If you cannot obtain records from your previous cesarean and do not know what type of incision was made, some providers will not offer TOLAC. Others may proceed with careful monitoring after weighing the likelihood that a low-transverse incision was used (most common).

_Very large baby (macrosomia):_

Estimated fetal weight over 4,000-4,500 grams is sometimes cited as a reason to recommend repeat cesarean. However, ultrasound estimates of baby size are often inaccurate. Most women with estimated large babies deliver vaginally without problems. This should be an individualized decision, not an automatic exclusion.

_Previous cesarean for cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) or "failure to progress":_

If your previous cesarean was performed because baby's head supposedly did not fit through your pelvis, some providers may be hesitant about TOLAC. However, true CPD is rare. Many "failure to progress" diagnoses are actually due to inadequate time, positioning, or labor support. Unless there is a clear anatomic reason why vaginal birth cannot occur, TOLAC remains reasonable to attempt.

#line(length: 100%)

== Cost-Benefit Analysis

Making the decision between VBAC attempt and planned repeat cesarean involves weighing what you gain against what you accept.

=== What You Get With VBAC Attempt

_If VBAC succeeds (60-80% chance):_
- Faster recovery (2-4 weeks vs. 6-8 weeks)
- Lower infection risk (1% vs. 3-5%)
- Less pain and shorter hospital stay
- No additional surgical scar tissue
- Preservation of reproductive health for future pregnancies
- Baby receives microbiome benefits
- Sense of empowerment and healing, particularly if previous cesarean was traumatic
- Experience of vaginal birth

_If VBAC attempt results in repeat cesarean (20-40% chance):_
- Same surgical risks as planned cesarean
- Possible longer recovery due to labor before surgery
- May feel disappointed or like you "failed" (though you did not)
- Experience of trying

Even if a VBAC attempt ultimately results in a cesarean, the labor process itself can benefit both mother and baby. Labor triggers hormonal changes that help prepare the body for breastfeeding — including colostrum production and milk readiness — and can support the baby's transition to breathing outside the womb. These hormonal shifts happen during labor regardless of how the birth ends.

=== What You Accept With VBAC Attempt

_Risks:_
- Uterine rupture: 0.5-0.7% (about 1 in 143-200)
- Emergency cesarean during labor
- Labor pain and the work of labor
- Possibility of repeat cesarean anyway
- Hospital restrictions during labor (monitoring, food limitations, etc.)

_Logistics:_
- Need to find VBAC-supportive provider and hospital
- May need to travel further if local hospital does not offer TOLAC
- May face more pressure or restrictions during labor
- Cannot schedule delivery date in advance

=== What You Get With Planned Repeat Cesarean

_Certainty:_
- Known date and time for delivery
- Can plan childcare, work leave, partner's schedule
- Avoids labor pain
- No risk of "failed" VBAC attempt
- May feel safer or less anxious

_Medical:_
- Lower uterine rupture risk (0.02-0.03%, though rupture can still occur)
- Predictable surgical setting

=== What You Accept With Planned Repeat Cesarean

_Surgical risks:_
- Major abdominal surgery with all associated risks
- Longer recovery (6-8 weeks)
- Higher infection risk (3-5%)
- More pain in postpartum period
- Adhesion formation (higher with each subsequent cesarean)
- Increased risks in future pregnancies (placenta previa, accreta)
- Limits on future pregnancies (most providers recommend no more than 3-4 cesareans)

_Birth experience:_
- Baby misses microbiome seeding from vaginal birth
- Delayed skin-to-skin and breastfeeding initiation
- Less participation in your baby's birth (positioned behind drape, limited mobility)
- May have regrets about not attempting VBAC

=== How to Decide

_Questions to ask yourself:_

- How important is avoiding surgery to me?
- How many more children do I plan to have?
- Am I a good candidate for VBAC based on my history and current pregnancy?
- Do I have access to truly supportive VBAC care?
- How do I feel about the risks of uterine rupture versus the risks of repeat cesarean?
- What does my intuition tell me?
- If I attempt VBAC and need repeat cesarean, will I feel that the attempt was worthwhile?
- If I choose planned cesarean, will I have regrets about not trying for VBAC?

_There is no wrong choice._ Both options carry risks and benefits. What matters is that you receive accurate information, supportive care, and respect for your autonomy in making this deeply personal decision.

#line(length: 100%)

== Our Take

Here is our direct perspective on VBAC:

_VBAC should be the default recommendation for most women with one prior low-transverse cesarean._ The evidence overwhelmingly supports this. Success rates of 60-80%, uterine rupture risk under 1%, and substantial benefits for both mother and baby make VBAC the optimal choice for most women in this situation.

_"Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" is outdated and harmful._ This 1916 statement referred to a surgical technique that is no longer used. Continuing to treat all prior cesarean patients as automatic repeat cesareans ignores a century of progress and denies women safer, evidence-based options.

_Access to VBAC is a justice issue._ The fact that only 14% of eligible women attempt VBAC despite 60-80% success rates reveals systemic barriers, not patient choice. Hospital policies driven by liability concerns and financial incentives limit access to evidence-based care.

_Provider choice matters enormously._ VBAC success depends heavily on provider support, patience with labor progress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions. Choosing a provider with high VBAC rates and evidence-based practices is the single most important action you can take.

_Informed consent must be truly informed._ Many women receive counseling that overstates the risks of VBAC while minimizing the risks of repeat cesarean. Balanced information about both options is essential. The cumulative risks of multiple cesareans must be part of the discussion, especially for women planning more children.

_Uterine rupture is serious but rare._ While the consequences can be severe, the risk is comparable to many other accepted pregnancy risks. The key is appropriate screening (excluding high-risk uterine incisions), continuous monitoring during labor, and capability for rapid cesarean if needed.

_Spontaneous labor is crucial._ Whenever possible, avoid induction. The 79% success rate with spontaneous labor versus 66% with induction is a significant difference. Routine early induction of TOLAC patients sets them up for failure.

_Time limits and arbitrary restrictions harm VBAC success._ Many repeat cesareans performed during TOLAC are due to institutional policies, not medical necessity. Women deserve adequate time for labor to progress, freedom to eat and drink, and ability to move and use comfort measures.

_VBAC heals._ For many women, particularly those with traumatic previous cesarean experiences, achieving VBAC is profoundly empowering. Even for those who end up with repeat cesarean, the experience of trying and being supported through the process can provide closure.

_Repeat cesarean is sometimes the right choice._ For women with classical incisions, previous uterine rupture, or multiple prior cesareans, planned repeat cesarean may be genuinely safer. For others, the certainty and control of scheduled surgery may outweigh the benefits of VBAC attempt. What matters is that the decision is informed and autonomous.

_We need systemic change._ VBAC access should not depend on where you live or which provider you happen to choose. Hospitals and providers should be held accountable for VBAC rates, transparent about their practices, and required to offer evidence-based TOLAC to eligible women.

_Your body, your choice, your birth._ Whether you attempt VBAC or choose planned cesarean, you deserve accurate information, respectful care, and support for your decision. No one else lives with the consequences of this choice. Trust yourself.
