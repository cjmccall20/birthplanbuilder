= Chapter 41: Pacifier Use <ch-pacifier-use>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Pacifiers are safe—and may even reduce SIDS risk #citation[1]—once breastfeeding is established (usually 3-4 weeks) #citation[1]. The "nipple confusion" concern is largely overstated #citation[2]. If you want to use one, wait until nursing is going well, then introduce without guilt.

== WHAT IT IS

Pacifiers satisfy a baby's natural urge to suck for comfort rather than nutrition. The debate centers on timing: Will early pacifier use interfere with breastfeeding? What do hospitals allow?

== THE EVIDENCE

*The nipple confusion debate:*
- Theory: Pacifiers teach different sucking mechanics that make breastfeeding harder
- Reality: A Cochrane review found pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants did not significantly affect breastfeeding duration when introduced after nursing was established #citation[2]
- The association between pacifiers and shorter breastfeeding may be correlation, not causation—mothers struggling with nursing may turn to pacifiers more often

*SIDS risk reduction:*
- Multiple studies show pacifier use during sleep reduces SIDS risk by approximately 50-60% #citation[3] #citation[4]
- The AAP recommends offering a pacifier at naptime and bedtime once breastfeeding is established #citation[1]
- This is one of the strongest arguments for pacifiers

*Other considerations:*
- Extended use (beyond age 2-3) is associated with dental problems #citation[5]
- May slightly increase ear infection risk #citation[6]
- Provides genuine comfort and helps babies self-soothe

*Hospital policies:*
- Baby-Friendly hospitals often restrict pacifiers #citation[7]
- These policies have evolved based on newer evidence balancing breastfeeding support with SIDS prevention
- You can request one regardless of hospital certification

*What IBCLCs (lactation consultants) generally recommend:*
- Most IBCLCs suggest waiting until breastfeeding is well-established before introducing a pacifier—typically 2-4 weeks. The reasoning is straightforward: in those early days, every time a baby sucks, it ideally happens at the breast to build supply and refine latch. A pacifier can satisfy the sucking urge without sending those "make more milk" signals.
- That said, some newer research suggests earlier pacifier introduction (even in the first week) may not harm breastfeeding outcomes in healthy, full-term babies. The evidence is evolving, and individual IBCLCs may differ in how strictly they advise waiting.
- The bottom line: if breastfeeding is a priority, waiting 2-4 weeks is the cautious approach. If breastfeeding is going unusually well and baby is gaining weight, some lactation consultants are comfortable with earlier introduction on a case-by-case basis.

== OUR TAKE

Wait until breastfeeding is going well (3-4 weeks), then feel free to offer a pacifier. The SIDS protection alone makes them worth considering for sleep.

*Not breastfeeding?* No reason to wait. Use one from day one if you want.

*At the hospital:* You can request a pacifier even at Baby-Friendly facilities. It's your choice.

*If baby refuses:* Many do. Don't force it.

Plan to wean by age 2-3 to avoid dental issues, but that's future you's problem.

=== Pro Tips for Choosing a Pacifier

- *Different babies like different shapes.* Pacifiers come in round, orthodontic, flat, and cylindrical nipple shapes—and babies can be surprisingly picky. Buy a few different brands before baby arrives so you have options ready. What your friend's baby loved, yours may spit out immediately.
- *Look for easy-to-clean designs.* One-piece silicone pacifiers (where the nipple, shield, and handle are all one solid piece) are the easiest to clean and will not trap mold, milk, or bacteria in crevices. Two-piece designs with seams can harbor moisture inside—check them regularly.
- *Avoid phthalates and BPA.* Look for pacifiers made from medical-grade silicone or natural rubber latex. Reputable brands will clearly state they are BPA-free and phthalate-free on the packaging.
- *Brands worth trying:* Philips Avent Soothie (the classic hospital pacifier—one-piece silicone, easy to clean), MAM (orthodontic shape, self-sterilizing case), NUK (contoured shape some babies prefer), and Ryan & Rose (one-piece cutie design popular with parents). These are general recommendations based on popularity and design quality, not endorsements. _(For more current reviews and brand comparisons, check our website—we keep an updated guide as new products come to market.)_

Pacifiers are a tool, not a failure.
