= Chapter 30: Eye Ointment (Erythromycin): Do You Need It? <ch-eye-ointment>

Understanding why hospitals apply antibiotic ointment to your newborn's eyes, and whether it makes sense for your situation.

#line(length: 100%)

== One-Page Overview

In the first moments after birth, a nurse will likely apply antibiotic ointment to your baby's eyes. In most U.S. states, this is required by law. The medication is erythromycin, and it's designed to prevent a serious eye infection called ophthalmia neonatorum.

This practice began over 140 years ago when gonorrhea caused blindness in roughly 3% of hospital-born babies. Before antibiotics existed, eye drops were a lifesaver. Today, however, most pregnant women are tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during prenatal care. If you've tested negative, your baby's risk of getting this infection is essentially zero.

Several countries, including the UK, Canada, and Scandinavian nations, no longer require routine eye ointment for all newborns. In 2024, the American Academy of Pediatrics called for "ongoing re-evaluation" of whether mandatory treatment still makes sense. Some U.S. states now allow parents to decline.

*Bottom line:* Eye ointment is genuinely important for babies whose mothers have untreated STIs or unknown infection status. For low-risk pregnancies with negative STI tests and prenatal care, you're treating a risk that doesn't exist. Your options depend on your state's law and your birth location's policies.

== What It Is and Why It's Given

=== A Brief History

In the 1880s, gonorrhea was a devastating problem for newborns. About 10% of babies born in hospital maternity wards developed eye infections #citation[1]. Without treatment, many went blind. Gonococcal ophthalmia was a leading cause of childhood blindness in the pre-antibiotic era.

In 1880, German doctor Carl Crede introduced silver nitrate drops applied right after birth. The results were dramatic: infection rates dropped from 10% to less than 1% #citation[1]. This became one of the great successes of preventive medicine. By the early 1900s, Crede's method was mandated by law in most countries and throughout the United States.

Silver nitrate worked well but caused painful eye irritation in most babies. By the 1980s, erythromycin ointment replaced it #citation[1]. Erythromycin works better against gonorrhea, offers some protection against chlamydia, and causes fewer side effects.

=== What Does It Actually Prevent?

*Gonorrhea:* Erythromycin is about 80% effective at preventing gonococcal eye infections. If a mother has untreated gonorrhea and delivers vaginally, about 30-50% of babies will develop the infection #citation[2]. Left untreated, it can cause blindness within 24 hours #citation[2].

*Chlamydia:* Here's something important: research shows erythromycin doesn't effectively prevent chlamydial eye infections #citation[3]. This is a significant limitation since chlamydia is now more common than gonorrhea in the U.S #citation[4].

*Current reality:* Thanks to prenatal screening and treatment, gonococcal eye infections are now rare in the United States. Many pediatricians practicing today have never seen a case.

== The Problem with Mandatory Protocols

=== When Testing Makes Prophylaxis Unnecessary

The fundamental issue with universal eye ointment is this: it treats a risk that no longer exists for most babies.

Standard prenatal care includes STI screening. If you tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and you're in a monogamous relationship with a tested partner, your baby's infection risk is essentially zero. Applying medication to prevent something that can't happen doesn't provide benefit, just side effects.

=== What the AAP Says Now

In 2024, the American Academy of Pediatrics took a significant position. They recommended "ongoing re-evaluation of the medical necessity of legislative mandates in the United States for universal neonatal eye prophylaxis" #citation[5].

Their updated guidance says eye ointment should be used "if gonorrhea infection is prevalent in the region and prenatal treatment cannot be ensured, or where required by law" #citation[5]. Notice the conditions: regional prevalence, inability to ensure treatment, or legal requirement. Not automatic application to everyone.

=== How Other Countries Handle This

Several developed nations have already moved away from mandatory universal prophylaxis:

- *United Kingdom:* No longer requires routine treatment #citation[6]
- *Canada:* Most provinces no longer require it; Canadian practice has moved toward targeted rather than universal prophylaxis #citation[7]
- *Denmark, Norway, Sweden:* No universal requirement #citation[6]

These countries have healthcare systems comparable to ours. They concluded that prenatal screening and treatment is sufficient, making routine eye ointment unnecessary for low-risk babies.

Countries that still require universal prophylaxis (like France, Italy, and Brazil) tend to have less robust prenatal screening systems.

=== The Resistance Problem

There's another concern: antibiotic resistance. Gonorrhea is becoming increasingly resistant to erythromycin. Studies show erythromycin resistance rates averaging around 21% globally, though rates vary widely by region and have increased substantially in recent years, reaching as high as 72% in some areas #citation[8]. The effectiveness studies showing erythromycin works 80% of the time were conducted decades ago, before widespread resistance emerged. This raises serious questions about whether the ointment is as effective as it used to be.

More concerning, research shows that erythromycin isn't very effective at preventing chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum #citation[3], despite chlamydia now being more common than gonorrhea in the United States #citation[4]. This means the ointment we're using doesn't effectively prevent the infection it's most likely to encounter.

== Effects on Your Newborn

=== Temporary Vision Blurring

Erythromycin causes blurred or cloudy vision for about 15-30 minutes while the ointment is present. For parents hoping for those first clear eye-to-eye moments with their newborn, this matters. Many describe gazing into their baby's eyes as deeply meaningful, and the ointment does interfere with that clarity.

=== Mild Irritation

About 13% of newborns who receive erythromycin develop mild "chemical pink eye," meaning eye redness and irritation without any actual infection #citation[9]. This is generally mild and goes away quickly, but it can be confusing for parents who wonder if something is wrong.

=== Potential Microbiome Implications

This is an emerging area of concern that deserves consideration: erythromycin is a systemic antibiotic, and there's evidence it may be absorbed beyond just the eyes.

*What we know:*
- Erythromycin can be absorbed systemically (into the bloodstream) even when applied topically to the eyes
- Research shows erythromycin affects gut motility and may impact the developing gut microbiome
- The first hours after birth are THE most critical window for establishing healthy gut bacteria, which form the foundation of your baby's immune system
- Early antibiotic exposure in newborns is linked to gut dysbiosis (bacterial imbalance), which increases risk of gastrointestinal issues like colic, yeast infections like thrush, and potentially longer-term conditions

*The concern:* When we apply erythromycin to your newborn's eyes during the golden hour—the exact moment when they're being colonized with beneficial bacteria from you—we may be introducing antibiotics that disrupt this foundational process.

*What we don't know:* There isn't extensive research specifically on how erythromycin eye ointment affects the infant gut microbiome. The research that exists on infant antibiotic exposure and microbiome disruption is mostly about oral or IV antibiotics, not topical eye ointment. However, given that:
- Erythromycin IS absorbed systemically from eye ointment
- We KNOW early antibiotic exposure disrupts gut bacteria establishment
- The timing coincides with the most critical window for microbiome seeding

This potential impact deserves to be part of your informed decision, even if the research is still limited.

For a low-risk baby whose mother tested negative for STIs, you're accepting a potential microbiome disruption to prevent an infection risk that doesn't exist for your baby.

=== Impact on Bonding

Research shows that newborns can distinguish between direct and indirect eye contact and prefer mutual gazing with their parents #citation[10]. The "golden hour" after birth is established as important for bonding, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding initiation #citation[11].

Whether temporary blurred vision meaningfully interferes with bonding isn't definitively proven. Bonding involves multiple factors beyond just clear vision in the first 30 minutes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives erythromycin prophylaxis a Grade A recommendation — meaning they recommend universal application for all newborns #citation[2]. They concluded that erythromycin is "not associated with serious harms." This is the strongest possible recommendation level, and it applies regardless of maternal STI status.

*A practical solution:* Many hospitals now delay eye ointment until after the "golden hour" is complete. The AAP recommends that routine procedures can be delayed until the first feeding is complete or at least one hour after delivery. This allows bonding time while still providing the medication within the effective window.

== When It Makes Sense

Eye ointment is genuinely important in certain situations. Understanding when it's truly indicated helps clarify who actually needs it.

=== Clear Reasons to Use Eye Ointment

*Untreated or unknown STI status:* If you tested positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia and weren't treated before delivery, eye prophylaxis for your newborn is medically appropriate.

*No prenatal care:* If you received little or no prenatal care and your STI status is unknown at delivery, eye ointment is a reasonable precaution.

*Higher-risk situations:* Even without confirmed infection, certain factors increase risk:
- Age under 25 (higher statistical risk of STI) #citation[4]
- Multiple sexual partners
- History of prior STI
- Symptoms suggesting infection at delivery
- Partner with known STI

*Practical note about cesareans:* The standard recommendation includes eye ointment regardless of delivery method. However, with a planned cesarean, the baby doesn't pass through the birth canal where transmission occurs. Some hospitals still recommend it "just in case," but the actual risk is essentially eliminated.

== When to Decline

=== Who Is Truly Low-Risk?

If you have:
- Received routine prenatal care
- Been screened for STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia)
- Tested negative
- Are in a monogamous relationship with a tested partner

Then your infection risk is essentially zero, and eye ointment prevents a risk that doesn't exist for you.

=== What Replaces Prophylaxis?

If you decline eye ointment based on low risk, what replaces it?

*Watch your baby's eyes:* Understanding that eye symptoms in a newborn can be serious. Red, swollen, or draining eyes in the first weeks of life warrant immediate medical attention.

*Have a plan for urgent care:* Know how to reach your pediatrician quickly and how to access emergency care if needed.

*Tell your pediatrician:* Ensure they know you declined prophylaxis so they can monitor accordingly.

*Be honest about risk:* If you have any actual risk factors, prophylaxis is genuinely safer.

=== Refusal Language

If you're declining eye ointment where legally permitted, here's specific language you can use:

*In your birth plan:*
"We are declining erythromycin eye ointment. I have tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia during prenatal care, and we understand the risks and benefits of this decision. We will monitor for any signs of eye infection and seek immediate care if symptoms develop."

*When speaking with hospital staff:*
"I've tested negative for both gonorrhea and chlamydia, which means my baby has no risk of the infections this ointment prevents. I understand the AAP now calls for re-evaluation of mandatory prophylaxis for low-risk babies like mine. We're declining the eye ointment and will watch for any concerning symptoms. I'd like to sign the refusal waiver."

*If they're resistant:*
"Can you help me understand what medical indication my baby has for antibiotic treatment given my negative STI screening? I'm trying to make an evidence-based decision."

=== The Legal Landscape

*State mandates vary widely.* Nearly all U.S. states mandate newborn eye prophylaxis by law #citation[5]. Failure to administer it is typically a misdemeanor for healthcare providers.

*Some states allow refusal.* California, Tennessee, and others permit parents to decline after signing a waiver or informed refusal form #citation[12]. West Virginia repealed its mandate entirely in 2025 #citation[13].

*Some states have strict liability.* In Texas, even if parents sign a waiver, healthcare providers can face criminal charges for not administering the ointment. New York provides no explicit mechanism for parents to refuse.

*Before birth, find out:*
- Is eye prophylaxis mandatory in your state?
- Can parents refuse?
- Is a waiver process available?

Contact your hospital or birthing center and ask directly: "What is your policy on parental refusal of eye prophylaxis?"

== Our Take

Eye ointment is a perfect example of how medical practice can lag behind evidence. A procedure that made complete sense 140 years ago, when gonorrhea caused widespread blindness and we had no way to screen or treat pregnant women, may no longer be necessary for most pregnancies today.

The evidence is clear: for low-risk pregnancies with prenatal care and negative STI testing, eye ointment prevents a risk that doesn't exist. Several developed countries have recognized this and eliminated mandatory treatment. The AAP now calls for reconsideration of U.S. mandates.

At the same time, this isn't a risk-free decision. Eye ointment matters for babies whose mothers have untreated infections or unknown status. The procedure itself is quick and likely not harmful.

*What makes sense:*

- *If you're low-risk with negative testing:* Consider whether your state allows refusal. If so, declining is reasonable. If not, delayed administration after bonding time is a good compromise.

- *If you have any risk factors:* Eye ointment provides genuine protection and is worth accepting.

- *Regardless of your choice:* Request that it be done after the golden hour so you get uninterrupted bonding time first.

The key is understanding your actual risk, knowing your legal options, and making a choice that aligns with your values. You deserve complete information, and your informed decision should be honored.

The procedure itself is quick and likely not harmful.
