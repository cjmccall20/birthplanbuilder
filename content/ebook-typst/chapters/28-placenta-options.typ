= Chapter 38: Placenta Options <ch-placenta-options>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Most people let the hospital dispose of the placenta. Some choose encapsulation (pills), burial, or other uses. The evidence for placenta consumption is weak, but it's your choice. Just know the benefits are mostly anecdotal.

== WHAT IT IS

After your baby is born, the placenta—the organ that nourished your baby for nine months—is delivered. You have several options for what happens to it:

1. *Hospital disposal* (default): Treated as medical waste
2. *Encapsulation*: Dehydrated, ground, put into capsules you swallow
3. *Burial/planting*: Ceremonial burial, often with a tree planted above
4. *Other uses*: Smoothies, art prints, keepsakes

=== Cultural Traditions

Across many cultures, the placenta is regarded as sacred—not medical waste. How families honor it varies widely:

- *Burial and tree planting:* This is one of the most widespread traditions. The placenta is buried and a tree is planted above it. As the tree grows, it represents the child—rooted in the land where they were born. This practice is found in Maori culture (New Zealand), many Pacific Islander traditions, parts of Southeast Asia, and among Indigenous communities in the Americas. Some families plant a fruit tree so the child can one day eat from the tree that grew alongside them.
- *Returning to the earth:* In Navajo tradition, the placenta is buried within the four sacred mountains to bind the child to their ancestral homeland. In Hmong culture, the word for placenta translates roughly to "jacket"—it is buried under the home so the soul can return to retrieve it after death.
- *Ceremony and spiritual significance:* In parts of West Africa and the Caribbean, the placenta may be washed, wrapped, and buried with ritual—sometimes with prayers, sometimes with items meant to bless the child's future. In some Indonesian traditions, the placenta is treated as the baby's spiritual sibling.
- *Lotus birth:* Some families choose to leave the umbilical cord and placenta attached until it separates naturally (typically 3-10 days). This practice is sometimes associated with spiritual beliefs about a gentler transition, though it carries infection risk and requires careful hygiene.

If any of these traditions resonate with you, plan ahead. Let your hospital or birth center know you want to take the placenta home—some require advance paperwork, and you will need a container and a plan for storage or transport.

== THE EVIDENCE

*Placenta encapsulation claims:*
- Prevents postpartum depression
- Increases milk supply
- Restores iron levels
- Boosts energy

*What research actually shows:*
- A 2018 systematic review found no evidence supporting these claims #citation[4]
- One study found encapsulated placenta did contain hormones, but at levels too low to have physiological effects #citation[2]
- No clinical trials have demonstrated benefits over placebo #citation[3]
- The placenta can harbor bacteria, and improper processing poses infection risk #citation[1]

*A concern worth knowing about:* The placenta is rich in pregnancy hormones—estrogen, progesterone, and others. Some practitioners have raised the question of whether re-introducing those hormones postpartum is actually desirable. After birth, a woman's body is naturally clearing pregnancy hormones to shift into recovery and milk production mode. Supplementing those hormones back in—even at low levels—could theoretically interfere with that process, affect mood regulation, or introduce hormones to a nursing baby through breast milk. This concern is not proven, but it is not unreasonable either, and it is worth weighing.

*The counterargument:* Many mammals eat their placenta #citation[7]. Proponents argue humans did historically too. However, there's no anthropological evidence of widespread placenta consumption in human cultures #citation[5].

*CDC warning:* In 2017, the CDC issued a warning after a newborn developed GBS infection linked to the mother's contaminated placenta capsules #citation[1].

*What has actual evidence:*
- Iron supplementation (if you're anemic)
- Adequate nutrition and rest
- Support from family/community
- Professional treatment for PPD if needed

== OUR TAKE

If encapsulation appeals to you, go for it—just don't rely on it as your primary strategy for postpartum recovery. The evidence doesn't support the claims #citation[6], but many women report feeling better (which could be placebo, and placebo effects are real #citation[8]). Be aware of the open question about re-introducing pregnancy hormones, and weigh that against the anecdotal reports of improved energy and mood.

*If you want to try it:*
- Use a reputable encapsulator with proper training—many doulas offer placenta encapsulation as part of their services, which can simplify logistics and ensure it is handled by someone experienced
- Ensure proper temperature control during processing
- Don't use if you had an infection during delivery
- If you are breastfeeding, monitor for any changes in supply or baby's behavior after starting the capsules

*If it sounds weird to you:* That's fine too. Hospital disposal is the default for good reason.

*The meaningful alternative:* Burial ceremonies can be beautiful and culturally significant. Planting a tree over the placenta—and watching it grow alongside your child—is a tradition practiced across many cultures for good reason. If ritual matters to you, this might be more meaningful than pills.

Your placenta did amazing work. How you honor that is personal.
