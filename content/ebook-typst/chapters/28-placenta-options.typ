= Placenta Options <ch-placenta-options>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Most people let the hospital dispose of the placenta. Some choose encapsulation (pills), burial, or other uses. The evidence for placenta consumption is weak, but it's your choice. Just know the benefits are mostly anecdotal.

== WHAT IT IS

After your baby is born, the placenta—the organ that nourished your baby for nine months—is delivered. You have several options for what happens to it:

1. *Hospital disposal* (default): Treated as medical waste
2. *Encapsulation*: Dehydrated, ground, put into capsules you swallow
3. *Burial/planting*: Ceremonial burial, often with a tree planted above
4. *Other uses*: Smoothies, art prints, keepsakes

== THE EVIDENCE

*Placenta encapsulation claims:*
- Prevents postpartum depression
- Increases milk supply
- Restores iron levels
- Boosts energy

*What research actually shows:*
- A 2018 systematic review found no evidence supporting these claims
- One study found encapsulated placenta did contain hormones, but at levels too low to have physiological effects
- No clinical trials have demonstrated benefits over placebo
- The placenta can harbor bacteria, and improper processing poses infection risk

*The counterargument:* Many mammals eat their placenta. Proponents argue humans did historically too. However, there's no anthropological evidence of widespread placenta consumption in human cultures.

*CDC warning:* In 2017, the CDC issued a warning after a newborn developed GBS infection linked to the mother's contaminated placenta capsules.

*What has actual evidence:*
- Iron supplementation (if you're anemic)
- Adequate nutrition and rest
- Support from family/community
- Professional treatment for PPD if needed

== OUR TAKE

If encapsulation appeals to you, go for it—just don't rely on it as your primary strategy for postpartum recovery. The evidence doesn't support the claims, but many women report feeling better (which could be placebo, and placebo effects are real).

*If you want to try it:*
- Use a reputable encapsulator with proper training
- Ensure proper temperature control during processing
- Don't use if you had an infection during delivery

*If it sounds weird to you:* That's fine too. Hospital disposal is the default for good reason.

*The meaningful alternative:* Burial ceremonies can be beautiful and culturally significant. If ritual matters to you, this might be more meaningful than pills.

Your placenta did amazing work. How you honor that is personal.
