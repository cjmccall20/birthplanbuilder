= Hearing Test <ch-hearing-test>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

The newborn hearing screening is painless, takes a few minutes, and catches hearing loss early when intervention makes the biggest difference. There's no real downside, making this a screening most families choose to complete. The evidence strongly supports this screening, and it's one of the most straightforward decisions in newborn care.

== WHAT IT IS

Before hospital discharge, your baby will have a quick hearing screening. It's usually done while baby is sleeping. A small earphone or probe is placed in or near the ear, and the device measures how the ear responds to sounds.

Two methods are used:
- *OAE (Otoacoustic Emissions):* Measures sound waves produced by the inner ear
- *ABR (Auditory Brainstem Response):* Measures brain response to sounds

Both are non-invasive and painless. The baby often sleeps right through it.

== THE EVIDENCE

*Why early detection matters:*
- Babies learn language from birth, even before they speak
- Hearing loss that isn't addressed early can cause permanent speech and language delays
- Children identified by 6 months and given intervention have significantly better language outcomes than those identified later
- About 1-3 babies per 1,000 are born with significant hearing loss

*Before universal screening:* The average age of hearing loss detection was 2-3 years—after critical language development windows had passed.

*With universal screening:* Detection now happens in the first months of life, allowing early intervention.

*What happens if baby doesn't pass:*
- Doesn't necessarily mean hearing loss—could be fluid in ear, baby was fussy, or technical issue
- A follow-up test is scheduled (usually within a few weeks)
- If confirmed, intervention begins: hearing aids, cochlear implants, sign language, speech therapy
- Early intervention programs are available in all states

*The test accuracy:* False positives are common (baby "fails" but has normal hearing). About 2-10% of babies need repeat testing, and most of those are fine. True hearing loss is confirmed through diagnostic testing.

== OUR TAKE

This is your decision, though the evidence here is about as one-sided as it gets in newborn care.

The case for screening is strong: the test is painless, takes just a few minutes, is completely non-invasive, and catches a condition where early detection dramatically improves outcomes. Babies identified with hearing loss before 6 months have significantly better language development than those caught later. If baby doesn't pass initially, don't panic—most "failures" are false positives, and follow-up testing usually confirms normal hearing.

Some families do decline, whether out of a preference for minimal intervention in the newborn period, concern about false positive anxiety and unnecessary follow-up, cultural or religious reasons, or a preference to have hearing assessed by their pediatrician later. These are personal considerations, and yours to weigh.

This is one we'd recommend without hesitation—but as with every decision in this book, it's yours to make for your family.
