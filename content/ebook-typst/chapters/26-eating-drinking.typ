= Chapter 23: Eating and Drinking During Labor <ch-eating-drinking>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

The traditional rule of "nothing by mouth" (NPO) during labor originated in the 1940s out of concern for emergency cesarean sections. If a woman needed an emergency c-section under general anesthesia, there was a small risk of aspiration — inhaling stomach contents into the lungs while unconscious. That risk shaped hospital policy for decades. But labor is intensely physical work. It can last many hours, sometimes well over a day, and it demands enormous energy. Many women today choose to eat and drink during labor because doing so helps them maintain energy, avoid fatigue, and stay fueled for what is essentially a marathon-level physical effort. Others prefer to fast, and both approaches are valid choices.

== WHAT IT IS

Many hospitals still restrict food and drink during labor, limiting women to ice chips. This policy originated in the 1940s when general anesthesia for cesareans carried a risk of aspiration (inhaling stomach contents). Modern anesthesia techniques have made this risk extremely rare.

The question is simple: Should you eat and drink during labor, or fast?

== THE EVIDENCE

*The aspiration fear:*
- The original concern was Mendelson's syndrome — aspiration during general anesthesia #citation[1]
- Modern cesareans almost always use regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal), not general
- When general anesthesia is needed, techniques have improved dramatically #citation[6]
- A 2013 Cochrane review found no cases of aspiration in any of the studies examined #citation[2]
- The actual risk is extremely rare #citation[6]
- For perspective: people undergo emergency surgery under general anesthesia all the time without fasting beforehand. If someone is in a car wreck on their way home from Golden Corral and needs emergency surgery, the operation is not withheld because they have a full stomach. Aspiration complications in those cases are extremely rare, and the same modern anesthesia techniques apply in the labor setting

*What happens when you don't eat:*
- Labor is physically demanding, comparable to a marathon
- Fasting leads to ketosis (your body burning fat for fuel), which can cause nausea and fatigue #citation[7]#citation[8]
- Low energy can slow labor and reduce your ability to push effectively #citation[9]
- Dehydration requires IV fluids, which limits mobility

*What the evidence says:*
- ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) now supports "modest amounts of clear liquids" for low-risk women #citation[3]
- The UK and many European countries have allowed eating during labor for years #citation[5]
- Studies show no increased complications from eating during labor for low-risk women #citation[4]

*What counts as low-risk:*
- No anticipated need for general anesthesia
- Normal labor progression
- No diabetes or other conditions affecting digestion

=== Why Some Women Choose to Fast

Not every woman in labor wants to eat or drink, and there are real reasons someone might prefer fasting:

- *Personal comfort.* Nausea is common during labor, especially in transition. For some women, the thought of food is genuinely unappealing, and eating may cause vomiting that adds to discomfort rather than helping.
- *Cultural or religious reasons.* Some women observe fasting practices tied to prayer, spiritual preparation, or cultural traditions surrounding birth. These reasons deserve the same respect as any medical consideration.
- *Peace of mind about aspiration risk.* Even though the risk is statistically very small, some women feel more comfortable knowing they've minimized it entirely. Comfort with risk is personal, not mathematical.
- *Planned epidural or cesarean.* If you already know you'll be receiving regional or general anesthesia, your provider may recommend NPO (nothing by mouth) guidelines. Following that recommendation can simplify your care plan and reduce anxiety.
- *Simply not wanting to.* Some women don't want to eat during labor and don't need a medical reason for that preference. Bodily autonomy includes the right to decline food just as much as the right to request it.

== OUR TAKE

This is a genuine decision with legitimate reasons on both sides.

*The case for eating and drinking during labor:* Your body is doing hard work — it needs fuel. Labor is physically demanding work, sometimes lasting many hours or well over a day. Fasting during that effort can lead to ketosis, fatigue, and nausea. For low-risk women, the evidence shows no increased complications from light eating, and many countries outside the US have allowed it for years. Women who eat and drink during labor often report more energy and less fatigue during pushing #citation[4]. Having access to food and fluids can also help you feel more in control and more comfortable.

*The case for fasting:* The original NPO policy exists for a reason — aspiration during general anesthesia is rare but serious. If there's any chance your labor could require general anesthesia, fasting reduces that risk to essentially zero. Beyond safety, many women find that nausea during labor makes eating counterproductive, and some simply feel better with an empty stomach. Cultural, religious, and personal preferences for fasting are equally valid considerations.

Women who value fueling the body for a long physical effort and want the freedom to eat on their own terms tend to lean toward light eating and drinking. Women who value minimizing any anesthesia-related risk, who are planning interventions where NPO is recommended, or who simply feel better fasting tend to lean toward restricting intake.

*Good foods to bring:* If you plan to eat during labor, think light, easy-to-digest, quick-energy foods that won't cause nausea. Honey sticks, energy bars, dates, bananas, applesauce pouches, crackers, and broth are all excellent choices. For hydration, coconut water, sports drinks, juice, and popsicles work well. You want foods you can eat in a few bites between contractions — not a full meal. Pack them in your hospital bag so they're ready when you are.

*A practical note:* If you want to eat but your hospital has a blanket NPO restriction, you can bring snacks in your bag and your partner can help get them to you. It would be very difficult for a hospital to physically prevent you from eating. This is your body and your labor — you get to decide whether that policy applies to you. That said, it's worth discussing your preference with your provider before labor begins so your wishes are documented in your birth plan. You can ask whether the restriction is based on your specific medical situation or on general policy — and then decide what feels right for you.
