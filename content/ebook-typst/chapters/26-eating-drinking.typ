= Eating and Drinking During Labor <ch-eating-drinking>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

The traditional rule of "nothing by mouth" during labor originated in the 1940s, though current evidence supports different options for low-risk women. Some choose to eat lightly and drink throughout labor; others prefer to fast. Both approaches are valid.

== WHAT IT IS

Many hospitals still restrict food and drink during labor, limiting women to ice chips. This policy originated in the 1940s when general anesthesia for cesareans carried a risk of aspiration (inhaling stomach contents). Modern anesthesia techniques have made this risk extremely rare.

The question is simple: Should you eat and drink during labor, or fast?

== THE EVIDENCE

*The aspiration fear:*
- The original concern was Mendelson's syndrome—aspiration during general anesthesia
- Modern cesareans almost always use regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal), not general
- When general anesthesia is needed, techniques have improved dramatically
- A 2013 Cochrane review found no cases of aspiration in any of the studies examined
- The actual risk is estimated at 0.7 per million—about the same as being struck by lightning

*What happens when you don't eat:*
- Labor is physically demanding, comparable to a marathon
- Fasting leads to ketosis (your body burning fat for fuel), which can cause nausea and fatigue
- Low energy can slow labor and reduce your ability to push effectively
- Dehydration requires IV fluids, which limits mobility

*What the evidence says:*
- ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) now supports "modest amounts of clear liquids" for low-risk women
- The UK and many European countries have allowed eating during labor for years
- Studies show no increased complications from eating during labor for low-risk women

*What counts as low-risk:*
- No anticipated need for general anesthesia
- Normal labor progression
- No diabetes or other conditions affecting digestion

=== Why Some Families Choose to Fast

Not every laboring person wants to eat or drink during labor, and there are real reasons someone might prefer fasting:

- *Personal comfort.* Nausea is common during labor, especially in transition. For some women, the thought of food is genuinely unappealing, and eating may cause vomiting that adds to discomfort rather than helping.
- *Cultural or religious reasons.* Some families observe fasting practices tied to prayer, spiritual preparation, or cultural traditions surrounding birth. These reasons deserve the same respect as any medical consideration.
- *Peace of mind about aspiration risk.* Even though the risk is statistically very small, some families feel more comfortable knowing they've minimized it entirely. Comfort with risk is personal, not mathematical.
- *Planned epidural or cesarean.* If you already know you'll be receiving regional or general anesthesia, your provider may recommend NPO (nothing by mouth) guidelines. Following that recommendation can simplify your care plan and reduce anxiety.
- *Simply not wanting to.* Some women don't want to eat during labor and don't need a medical reason for that preference. Bodily autonomy includes the right to decline food just as much as the right to request it.

== OUR TAKE

This is a genuine decision with legitimate reasons on both sides.

*The case for eating and drinking during labor:* Labor is physically demanding work, sometimes lasting many hours. Fasting during that effort can lead to ketosis, fatigue, and nausea. For low-risk women, the evidence shows no increased complications from light eating, and many countries outside the US have allowed it for years. Having access to food and fluids can also help you feel more in control and more comfortable. Good options, if you choose to eat, include toast, crackers, fruit, broth, juice, sports drinks, honey sticks, and popsicles.

*The case for fasting:* The original NPO policy exists for a reason—aspiration during general anesthesia is rare but serious. If there's any chance your labor could require general anesthesia, fasting reduces that risk to essentially zero. Beyond safety, many women find that nausea during labor makes eating counterproductive, and some simply feel better with an empty stomach. Cultural, religious, and personal preferences for fasting are equally valid considerations.

Families who value fueling the body for a long physical effort and want the freedom to eat on their own terms tend to lean toward light eating and drinking. Families who value minimizing any anesthesia-related risk, who are planning interventions where NPO is recommended, or who simply feel better fasting tend to lean toward restricting intake.

Whatever you decide, it's worth discussing your preference with your provider before labor begins so your wishes are documented in your birth plan. If your hospital has a blanket restriction policy, you can ask whether the restriction is based on your specific medical situation or on general policy—and then decide what feels right for your family.
