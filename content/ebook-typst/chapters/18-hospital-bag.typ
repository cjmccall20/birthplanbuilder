= Hospital Bag Checklist: What You Actually Need <ch-hospital-bag>

Pack your hospital bag between 35-37 weeks. Not because you'll need it that early, but because labor doesn't check your calendar. A bag sitting by the door means one less thing to think about when contractions start.

Here's the thing about hospital bag lists: most include 40+ items when you really need about 15. You're going for one to three nights, not a week-long vacation. The hospital provides more than you'd expect. Over-packing just means more stuff to haul home while recovering with a newborn.

== THE ESSENTIALS (Don't Leave Without These)

These items genuinely matter. Everything else is optional.

- _Insurance card and ID_ - You'll register upon arrival
- _Phone and charger_ (get a 10-foot cord - hospital outlets are always behind the bed)
- _Birth plan copies_ - Two or three printed copies for nurses and doctors
- _Going-home outfit for you_ - Something loose that fit when you were 5-6 months pregnant
- _Going-home outfit for baby_ - Weather-appropriate, 0-3 month size
- _Car seat_ - Properly installed before labor begins. Staff will check before discharge
- _Comfortable robe or cardigan_ - Hospital gowns open in the back
- _Slip-on shoes or slippers_ - You'll be walking the halls
- _Hair ties_ - Simple but essential during labor
- _Toiletries_ - Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, face wash (hospital basics are very basic)
- _Glasses or contacts_ - If you need them

- _Disposable underwear_ - Depends or similar (more on this below)
- _Snacks_ - A few granola bars, crackers, dried fruit

== FOR LABOR

Labor can last hours or days. Pack items that help you cope with contractions and pass the time during early labor.

=== Comfort Items
- _Your own pillow_ - Hospital pillows are thin and plastic-covered. Bring one from home in a bright, non-white pillowcase so it doesn't get left behind
- _Fuzzy socks or gripper socks_ - Hospital floors are cold and slippery
- _Lightweight robe_ - Easier than hospital gowns when walking, especially if you want to cover up
- _Lip balm_ - Breathing techniques dry out your mouth
- _Hair ties and headbands_ - Keep hair off your face

=== Natural Pain Management
- _Massage oil or lotion_ - For back rubs during contractions
- _Tennis balls_ - For counter-pressure on your lower back
- _Heat pack_ (microwavable rice sock) - Hospital may have these, but bring your own to be safe
- _Comb_ - Squeezing a comb in your palm during contractions activates acupressure points

=== Food and Drinks
Check your hospital's policy first - some restrict eating during labor.

- _Clear liquids_ - Coconut water, sports drinks, broth packets
- _Sugar-free hard candy_ - Keeps your mouth moist without making you thirstier
- _Light snacks_ - Crackers, applesauce pouches, honey sticks for energy
- _Water bottle with a straw_ - Easier to drink while lying down

=== Entertainment for Early Labor
Early labor can take 12+ hours. You might be bored before you're uncomfortable.

- _Phone loaded with shows or podcasts_ - Download offline, hospital WiFi is unreliable
- _Book or magazine_ - Screen-free option
- _Headphones_ - For your own entertainment and for focus during active labor

=== The Big One
- _Extra-long phone charger_ - 10 feet minimum. Outlets in hospital rooms are always in the worst spots. You'll want your phone for timing contractions, music, and yes, those first photos.

== FOR AFTER BIRTH

Recovery is messier than pregnancy books prepare you for. Pack accordingly.

=== Clothing
- _Going-home outfit_ - Loose dress or stretchy pants with an empire waist. Skip anything with a tight waistband. Your belly will still look 5-6 months pregnant.
- _Nursing bras or tanks_ - Soft, no underwire. Your breasts will be tender and changing size.
- _Comfy pajamas or nightgown_ - Optional. Hospital gowns work fine, but some people feel more human in their own clothes.
- _Cardigan or zip-up hoodie_ - Easy to nurse in and hospital rooms run cool

=== The Underwear Situation
The hospital provides mesh underwear and giant pads. They work. But many experienced moms swear by bringing their own Depends-style disposable underwear instead. Here's why:

_Depends (or similar) are better because:_
- Everything stays in place - no shifting pads
- You don't have to worry about leaks onto hospital bedding
- Easier to pull up and down when you're sore
- Feel more like actual underwear than mesh
- No bulky pad situation

Bring a pack in your hospital bag and a pack at home. You'll use them for 1-2 weeks postpartum.

=== Toiletries
Hospital toiletries are functional but not pleasant. Bring:
- _Your own shampoo and conditioner_ - Travel sizes work
- _Face wash and moisturizer_
- _Deodorant_
- _Toothbrush and toothpaste_
- _Makeup_ - Only if it makes you feel better. Most people skip it.

#line(length: 100%)

== FOR BABY

This list is short because the hospital provides almost everything. Don't overpack baby items.

=== What You Actually Need to Bring
- _Going-home outfit_ - Weather-appropriate. In winter, choose something that works with a car seat harness (avoid puffy snowsuits). In summer, a lightweight cotton outfit with a hat for sun protection.
- _Receiving blanket_ - For the car seat in cold weather. Never put baby in a puffy coat in the car seat.
- _Car seat_ - Installed correctly in your vehicle BEFORE labor. This is non-negotiable. The hospital won't discharge you without a safe car seat. Get it checked at a local fire station or certified inspection site if you're not confident in the installation.

=== What You Don't Need to Bring
- Multiple outfits (baby will wear hospital blankets and a onesie)
- Diapers (hospital provides them)
- Wipes (hospital provides them)
- Pacifier (wait until breastfeeding is established, usually 3-4 weeks)
- Hats (hospital provides them)
- Socks and mittens (baby will be swaddled)

_One outfit. One blanket. Car seat. That's it._

== FOR YOUR PARTNER OR SUPPORT PERSON

Labor can last 24+ hours. Your support person needs supplies too.

=== Essentials
- _Change of clothes_ - At least one full outfit, possibly two
- _Toiletries_ - Toothbrush, deodorant, etc.
- _Phone charger_ - Their own, don't share
- _Comfortable shoes_ - They'll be on their feet providing support

=== Food Situation
Your partner can eat when you can't (if you're restricted). They should:
- _Pack substantial snacks_ - Nuts, protein bars, dried fruit, crackers
- _Bring cash or card_ - For cafeteria and vending machines
- _Know the hospital food options_ - Cafeteria hours, nearby restaurants, delivery options

=== Entertainment
- _Book, tablet, or downloaded shows_ - For early labor downtime
- _Laptop_ - If they need to work remotely (labor takes a while sometimes)

=== Support Items
- _Bathing suit_ - If you're using a labor tub, your partner may want to get in with you
- _Camera_ - If you want photos beyond phone quality
- _Watch with a second hand_ - For timing contractions if phone dies

== NATURAL BIRTH ADD-ONS

Planning an unmedicated birth? These items help create a calm environment and provide natural pain relief.

=== Atmosphere
- _Battery-powered LED candles_ - Real flames aren't allowed. Warm white gives a calming glow.
- _Fairy lights_ - Battery-powered string lights can transform a clinical room
- _Bluetooth speaker_ - For hypnobirthing tracks, meditation, or calming music
- _Eye mask_ - For resting between contractions and blocking harsh hospital lighting
- _Focal point object_ - Something to focus on during contractions. A photo, a small statue, anything meaningful.

=== Scent
- _Essential oils_ - Check hospital policy first. If allowed:
  - Lavender for relaxation
  - Peppermint for nausea
  - Clary sage to support contractions (use only during active labor)
  - Frankincense for grounding
- _Diffuser_ - Portable battery-powered diffuser
- _Tissues or cotton balls_ - For placing essential oil drops if diffuser isn't allowed

=== Pain Management
- _TENS unit_ - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The BabycareTENS brand has a specific "boost" mode for contractions. Place electrodes on lower back during early labor. Many people find significant relief from this.
- _Massage tools_ - Roller balls, wooden massage tools, anything that helps your partner apply counter-pressure without tiring out their hands
- _Birth ball_ - Hospital usually provides these, but confirm
- _Rice sock_ - Tube sock filled with rice, microwave to warm. Amazing for back labor.
- _Peanut ball_ - Helps open pelvis if laboring on your side

=== Mental Focus
- _Birth affirmation cards_ - Printed or on your phone
- _Hypnobirthing audio_ - Downloaded to your phone (don't rely on streaming)
- _Headphones_ - To listen without distraction
- _Printed birth preferences_ - Multiple copies

== PRO TIPS

_Pack early._ 35-37 weeks. Babies arrive on their own schedule.

_Use separate bags._ One small bag for labor (things you'll want access to immediately), one bag for postpartum and baby stuff, partner has their own bag. Label them.

_Leave valuables home._ No expensive jewelry, no large amounts of cash. Hospital rooms have limited security.

_Wear your going-home outfit to the hospital._ It'll be loose and comfortable - perfect for laboring in at home before you head in. Then you have a real outfit to go home in and don't need to bring one.

_Preload your phone._ Download music, hypnobirthing tracks, shows, podcasts before you go. Hospital WiFi is notoriously unreliable.

_Bring an empty bag._ You'll accumulate hospital supplies, paperwork, and gifts. Having a collapsible bag to bring everything home is helpful.

_Know your hospital's specific policies._ Call ahead and ask:
- Can you eat during labor?
- Are essential oils/diffusers allowed?
- Do they provide birthing balls?
- What's the visitor policy?

_Pack snacks for after delivery._ Hospital kitchen may be closed when you deliver. Having crackers, nuts, or granola bars means you can eat when you're starving at 3am.

_Bring your own pillow._ Use a distinctive pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed up with hospital linens.
