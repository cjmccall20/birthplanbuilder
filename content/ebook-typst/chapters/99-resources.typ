== A Note on Research

Medical knowledge evolves. Recommendations change as new studies emerge. We encourage you to:

1. _Check publication dates_ - Especially for rapidly evolving topics
2. _Look for primary sources_ - When possible, read the studies, not just summaries
3. _Consider the source_ - Who funded the research? Who benefits from the conclusions?
4. _Trust your instincts_ - You know your body and your baby better than anyone

The goal isn't to become a medical expert—it's to become an informed participant in your own care.
