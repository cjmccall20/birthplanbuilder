= Chapter 24: Hospital Admission: What to Expect and What You Can Control <ch-hospital-admission>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

Hospital admission involves triage (where staff determine if you're in active labor), standard procedures (IV placement, monitoring strip, cervical check, vitals), and paperwork. Being sent home from triage is common and not a failure -- it often means your body is still warming up. You have choices at every step: you can request a hep lock instead of continuous IV, ask for intermittent monitoring, limit cervical checks (especially after your water breaks, since each check increases infection risk), and decline or delay procedures that aren't urgent. Pre-registering around 36 weeks and touring your hospital ahead of time dramatically reduce stress on the day. Your partner's job during admission is to handle everything except labor itself -- logistics, communications, advocacy, and environment -- so you can focus entirely on the work your body is doing.

*Bottom line:* The first hour at the hospital sets the tone for your entire birth. Arrive informed, communicate your priorities clearly, build rapport with your nurse, and remember that standard procedures are recommendations, not requirements.

Arriving at the hospital in labor can feel overwhelming. You're managing contractions, feeling excited and nervous, and suddenly you're faced with paperwork, questions, and medical procedures. Knowing what to expect—and what choices you have—can help you feel more in control during this transition.

This guide walks you through the typical admission process, explains your options, and helps you set a positive tone for your birth experience from the very first moment.

== EVERY HOSPITAL IS DIFFERENT

Before diving into what admission typically looks like, here's something worth knowing: no two hospitals handle it exactly the same way. Policies around monitoring, IV requirements, eating during labor, visitor rules, and even who does your initial assessment can vary widely from one facility to the next.

*Tour your hospital ahead of time.* Most hospitals offer labor and delivery tours, and taking one is one of the best things you can do to prepare. You'll see the rooms, learn the layout, find out where to park and which entrance to use at 2 a.m., and — most importantly — get a feel for how that facility approaches labor. Ask questions during the tour: What's your monitoring policy? Can I eat during labor? What's your nurse-to-patient ratio? Do you have tubs or showers available? Understanding these policies before you're having contractions takes a huge weight off game day.

*What if you end up somewhere unplanned?* Life doesn't always cooperate. Maybe you go into labor while traveling. Maybe your home birth doesn't go as planned and you transfer in. Maybe your hospital is on diversion and sends you elsewhere. If you end up at a facility you haven't toured and aren't familiar with, that's okay — but know that the procedures and culture may be different from what you researched. Lean on your partner or doula to ask questions, communicate your preferences clearly, and remember that the core principles in this chapter still apply no matter where you are.

== THE TRIAGE PROCESS

=== What Happens When You Arrive

When you walk into Labor and Delivery (or get dropped off at the entrance while your partner parks), your first stop is usually triage. Think of triage as the "assessment area" where staff determines whether you're in active labor and need to be admitted.

_Call the hospital on your way in._ Before you leave the house — or as soon as you decide it's go time — call the labor and delivery unit and let them know you're coming. Tell them how far apart your contractions are, whether your water has broken, and how far away you are. This gives them time to get a room ready, pull up your pre-registration, and have a nurse waiting for you. It's a simple step that can make your arrival significantly smoother.

Here's what typically happens:

_Check-in at the desk._ You'll give your name and let them know you think you're in labor. If you pre-registered (highly recommended!), this goes much faster.

_Move to a triage room._ This is usually a smaller room with a bed, monitoring equipment, and a curtain for privacy. You may share the triage area with other women also being evaluated.

_Put on a hospital gown._ A nurse will ask you to change and get into bed so they can assess you.

_Get connected to monitors._ They'll place two elastic belts around your belly—one monitors your baby's heart rate, the other tracks your contractions.

_Answer questions._ The nurse will ask about your contractions (when they started, how far apart, how intense), whether your water broke, your medical history, and your pregnancy details.

=== Being Checked for Labor Progress

The main question triage needs to answer: Are you in active labor?

To figure this out, a nurse or provider will likely:

- _Do a cervical check_ to see how dilated (open) and effaced (thinned) your cervix is. Fair warning: cervical checks are uncomfortable at best and genuinely painful for many women, especially during active contractions. They're brief, but it helps to know it's coming so you can breathe through it.
- _Monitor contractions_ to see their pattern and strength
- _Check baby's heart rate_ to make sure baby is tolerating labor well
- _Review your history_ including any complications or risk factors

This evaluation usually takes 20-60 minutes. If your labor status is unclear, they might have you walk the halls for an hour and then recheck you to see if you've progressed.

=== When You Might Be Sent Home

Don't be surprised or embarrassed if this happens—it's incredibly common! You might be sent home if:

- You're less than 4-6 centimeters dilated (depending on the hospital)
- Your contractions are irregular or not strong enough
- You haven't shown change over the observation period
- Your water hasn't broken

Being sent home doesn't mean you did anything wrong. It's often called "false labor" or "prodromal labor," but there's nothing false about it—your body is just warming up. Going home to labor longer in your own comfortable space is often better than being admitted too early.

_When they'll definitely keep you:_
- Your water has broken (even without contractions)
- You're in active labor (usually 5-6+ cm dilated with regular contractions)
- There are concerns about you or baby that need monitoring
- You're having a medical emergency

#line(length: 100%)

== STANDARD PROCEDURES

Once you're officially admitted, you'll move to a labor room. Here's what typically happens in the first hour or so:

=== Paperwork

Even if you pre-registered, there's usually more paperwork at admission. This includes:

- _Consent forms_ for treatment, procedures, and potential emergencies
- _Reviewing your birth preferences_ with the admitting nurse
- _Insurance and identification verification_
- _Signing HIPAA privacy forms_
- _Contact information_ for your emergency contact

_Pro tip:_ Pre-register around 36 weeks! Most hospitals let you complete forms ahead of time, either online or in person. This dramatically reduces the paperwork you'll deal with while having contractions.

=== IV Placement or Hep Lock

Most hospitals want IV access established when you're admitted. This might be:

_A full IV line:_ A needle placed in your hand or arm, connected to tubing and a bag of fluids that continuously drip into your body.

_A hep lock (saline lock):_ The same needle placement, but capped off instead of connected to fluids. It gives them quick access if needed but doesn't tether you to an IV pole.

Why do they want this?
- Quick access for medications if needed
- Ability to give fluids if you become dehydrated
- Emergency access if complications arise
- Required if you want an epidural

See our #link(<ch-iv-hep-lock>)[IV vs Hep Lock chapter] for more on this decision.

=== Fetal Monitoring Strip

You'll have the same monitoring belts from triage placed again. The initial strip usually lasts 20-30 minutes and establishes a "baseline" for how your baby is doing.

_Continuous monitoring_ means wearing the belts throughout labor. Many hospitals default to this.

_Intermittent monitoring_ means checking baby's heart rate periodically (often every 15-30 minutes in active labor) rather than constantly.

See our #link(<ch-fetal-monitoring>)[Fetal Monitoring chapter] for a deeper dive.

=== Cervical Check

The admitting nurse or provider will typically do a cervical exam to establish where you are in labor. As mentioned above, this will be uncomfortable — it involves a gloved hand reaching into the vaginal canal to feel the cervix, and during labor when everything is already sensitive and tight, it can be quite painful. It's usually quick (under a minute), but knowing that ahead of time helps you prepare mentally. Ask your nurse to wait until you're between contractions if possible, and focus on slow breathing through it.

They're checking:

- _Dilation:_ How open your cervix is (measured 0-10 centimeters)
- _Effacement:_ How thin your cervix has become (measured as a percentage)
- _Station:_ How far baby has descended into your pelvis (-3 to +3)
- _Position:_ Which way baby is facing

*A note on infection risk:* Every cervical check introduces a small risk of infection, and this risk goes up significantly if your water has already broken #citation[1]#citation[2]#citation[3]#citation[4]. Once membranes have ruptured, the protective barrier between the outside world and your baby is gone, and each exam can potentially introduce bacteria. This is one reason to be thoughtful about how many cervical checks you consent to — especially after your water breaks. You can always ask, "Is this check necessary right now, or can we wait?"

=== Vital Signs

Your blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and oxygen levels will be checked. These are typically repeated every 1-4 hours throughout labor depending on your situation.

#line(length: 100%)

== WHAT YOU CAN DECLINE OR DELAY

Here's something important to understand: You have the right to informed consent for every procedure. This means nothing should happen to your body without your permission, and you can ask questions, request alternatives, or decline interventions.

That said, declining everything isn't the goal. The goal is making informed choices that align with your values while keeping you and baby safe. Here are some common areas where you have options:

=== Routine IV vs. Hep Lock

_What you can ask for:_ A hep lock instead of continuous IV fluids. This gives you more freedom to move and isn't attached to a pole.

_Good to know:_ If you become dehydrated, need medication, or want an epidural, you'll need fluids. A hep lock makes that quick to set up.

_When this might not be an option:_ If you have certain medical conditions, are being induced, or your provider has specific concerns.

=== Continuous vs. Intermittent Monitoring

_What you can ask for:_ Intermittent monitoring, where the nurse checks baby's heart rate periodically rather than keeping you attached to monitors continuously.

_Good to know:_ Intermittent monitoring lets you move more freely, use the shower or tub, and change positions easily. Research shows it's safe for low-risk labors — large studies comparing continuous and intermittent monitoring found no difference in overall outcomes for babies #citation[5]#citation[6]#citation[7]#citation[8].

_When this might not be an option:_ If you have risk factors, are being induced, have an epidural, or if baby showed any concerning patterns on the initial strip.

=== Limiting Cervical Checks

_What you can ask for:_ Fewer cervical checks. You can decline or delay these exams, especially if your water has broken (each check slightly increases infection risk once membranes have ruptured).

_Good to know:_ Dilation isn't the only sign of progress. Many women find frequent checks discouraging when numbers don't change quickly.

_When they're more important:_ If your provider needs information to make decisions about your care, or if you want to know where you are.

=== Knowing Your Rights

You always have the right to:

- _Ask questions:_ "What are the benefits? What are the risks? What are my alternatives? What happens if I wait?"
- _Request time:_ "Can I have a few minutes to think about this?"
- _Decline:_ "I understand the recommendation, but I'd like to decline for now."
- _Get a second opinion:_ For non-emergency situations

_Important:_ Exercising your rights should involve conversation, not conflict. A good approach is: "I'd like to understand more about why you're recommending this." Most providers will explain their reasoning, and you can make a decision together.

#line(length: 100%)

== SETTING THE TONE

The first hour at the hospital sets the emotional tone for your entire birth experience. Here's how to start strong:

=== Sharing Your Birth Preferences

Bring copies of your birth plan (if you have one) and give one to your admitting nurse. But don't just hand it over—talk about it.

_What to say:_ "I put together some preferences for labor. Can we go over the highlights together? I'd love to know what's realistic here."

This opens a conversation and shows you're flexible but informed. Most nurses appreciate knowing what matters to you.

_Focus on your priorities._ Don't get hung up on every detail. What are the 3-5 things that matter most? Make sure those are clearly communicated.

=== Establishing Relationship with Your Nurse

Your labor nurse is your biggest ally. In most hospitals, your nurse is with you far more than your doctor or midwife, who often arrives mainly for the pushing stage.

_Ways to build rapport:_
- Learn their name and use it
- Ask how long they've been doing this (shows interest)
- Thank them genuinely when they help you
- Be direct about what helps you cope ("I do better with quiet encouragement" or "Please tell me what's happening")
- Ask their opinion when appropriate ("What have you seen work in situations like this?")

_If it's not working:_ If you and your nurse aren't clicking, your partner can quietly ask the charge nurse about switching. This happens and isn't personal—sometimes personalities just don't mesh.

=== Partner as Protector and Advocate

Here's the golden rule for partners: *Your job is to make sure she is as comfortable as possible and shield her from handling anything else.* She has one job right now — labor. It is the hardest physical thing she may ever do, a genuine marathon, and every ounce of her focus and energy needs to go toward that. She's not helpless, but she shouldn't have to split her attention. You handle everything else.

That means:

- _Handle all logistics:_ Parking, bags, paperwork, checking in at the desk, finding the room — all of it. She shouldn't be fumbling with insurance cards between contractions.
- _Manage communications:_ You're the point of contact for family and friends. Send the updates, answer the texts, field the phone calls. She doesn't need her phone buzzing while she's working through transition.
- _Advocate with staff:_ You know her birth preferences. If she wanted intermittent monitoring, speak up. If a nurse is suggesting something she'd want to discuss first, buy her time. "Can we have a minute to talk about that?" is one of the most powerful sentences you can learn.
- _Read the room — literally:_ If the lights are bright and you know she labors better in dim lighting, figure out how to get them turned down. If she's cold, get a blanket. If she's hungry and allowed to eat, go find her food. If the room is too loud, quietly ask people to lower their voices. You are managing her environment so she doesn't have to.
- _Run interference:_ Visitors showing up too early? Redirect them to the waiting room. Someone being too chatty? Politely create space. A well-meaning family member calling for the fifth time? Handle it.
- _Be her memory:_ Write down names of nurses and providers, note any numbers they give you (dilation, baby's heart rate), and keep track of the birth preferences so you can reference them when decisions come up. She won't remember — and shouldn't have to.

Think of it this way: she is running a marathon. Your job is to hand her water, clear the road, and make sure nobody gets in her way. She's doing the extraordinary physical work. You're doing everything else.

*Consider having a doula.* With both a partner and a doula present, there's always someone by her side — even when you need to step out for food, use the restroom, or take a breather. A doula brings experience and calm to the room, can suggest comfort measures you might not think of, and frees you up to be emotionally present rather than scrambling to figure out what to do next. Two support people means more hands, more coverage, and a better experience for everyone. See #link(<ch-doula-support>)[our Doula Support chapter] for the evidence, cost breakdown, and how to find the right doula.

=== "Starting As You Mean to Go On"

There's wisdom in this old phrase. If you want:

- _A calm, quiet environment:_ Keep lights dim and voices low from the start
- _To move freely:_ Get up and walk or use the birth ball right away rather than settling into bed
- _Limited interventions:_ Make your preferences known before they become assumptions
- _Active participation in decisions:_ Start asking questions during admission

Your early actions signal to staff what kind of experience you're looking for. It's easier to maintain a tone you've established than to change course later.

== DIFFERENT ADMISSION SCENARIOS

Not all admissions happen the same way. Here's what to expect in different situations:

=== Emergency Admission

If you arrive with significant bleeding, very high blood pressure, severe pain, decreased fetal movement, or other emergencies, the process looks different:

- Triage moves fast—assessment happens in minutes
- Multiple staff may be involved simultaneously
- Interventions happen quickly, sometimes with explanations coming after
- You'll be monitored closely and may go directly to a labor room or OR
- Your support person might be asked to wait briefly while initial assessment happens

_What helps:_ Try to stay calm and trust the process. Staff are trained for emergencies. Once things stabilize, you can ask for explanations about what happened and what comes next.

=== Scheduled Induction Arrival

If you're being induced, admission feels more organized:

- You'll have a scheduled arrival time (often early morning)
- Go directly to the labor floor rather than triage
- Less urgency—more time for paperwork and questions
- IV placement happens early since you'll need fluids and medications
- Your provider will explain the induction plan

_What helps:_ Ask how the induction will proceed step-by-step. Find out how long each phase typically takes. Get comfortable—early induction can be slow, so bring entertainment.

=== Planned C-Section Arrival

Scheduled cesareans have their own process:

- Arrive 1-2 hours before scheduled surgery time
- Go to a pre-op area rather than labor room
- Change into a surgical gown
- IV placed for fluids and medications
- Meet with anesthesiology to discuss your spinal or epidural
- Surgical site may be shaved and cleaned
- Walk or wheelchair to the operating room

_What helps:_ Ask when your support person can join you (usually after the spinal is placed). Confirm your preferences for the surgery—delayed cord clamping, skin-to-skin in OR, etc.

#line(length: 100%)

== PRO TIPS

=== Making Admission Go Smoothly

_Before you leave home:_
- Confirm you're really in labor (call the hospital line if unsure)
- Have bags packed and by the door
- Eat a light snack if you can (you may not eat again for a while)
- Put on comfortable clothes easy to change out of
- Bring your ID and insurance card somewhere accessible

_Pre-registration makes everything easier._ Seriously. Do it around 36 weeks.

_Bring multiple copies of your birth plan._ Nurses change shifts, and you may see different providers.

_Arrive during the right stage of labor._ You may have heard of the "4-1-1 rule" — contractions 4 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour. This book advocates the *3-1-1 rule* instead: contractions 3 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour. See our #link(<ch-when-to-go>)[Stages of Labor chapter] for why we recommend the 3-1-1 rule. Coming too early often means being sent home, but don't wait too long either.

_Bring your own pillow._ It's more comfortable, smells like home, and instantly makes the room feel more yours. Put it in a colorful pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed up with hospital linens.

_Know the parking situation._ Where is the drop-off? Where does your partner park? Is there a cost? Figure this out ahead of time.

_Have phone chargers ready._ Labor can be long. Dead phones are the last thing you need.

_Wear your own labor gown if you want._ Hospital gowns are free and functional, but many women prefer their own birthing gowns. Just know it might get messy.

=== The Words That Open Doors

When you want something:
- "Is it possible to...?"
- "I'd prefer to try..."
- "Can we talk about alternatives?"
- "What would you recommend?"

When you need time:
- "Can I have a few minutes to think about this?"
- "My partner and I need to discuss this privately."
- "Is this urgent or can we revisit it in an hour?"

When declining:
- "I understand, and I'd like to decline for now."
- "I'd prefer to wait on that. Can we reassess later?"
- "Thank you for the recommendation. I've decided to..."

=== Things Nurses Wish Patients Knew

- _They want you to have a good experience too._ Most nurses went into this field because they love helping families through birth.
- _Clear communication helps everyone._ Tell them what you need instead of hoping they guess.
- _Shift change happens._ Don't take it personally when your nurse leaves. Get to know the new one.
- _They've seen it all._ Nothing you do will shock or embarrass them.
- _Flexibility goes both ways._ When you're flexible with them, they're often more flexible with you.

== TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

This might be the most important section in this chapter.

You know your body. You know your baby. If something feels off — if baby isn't moving as much as normal, if contractions feel different from what you expected, if you just have a gut feeling that something isn't right — *go to the hospital.* Don't wait. Don't second-guess yourself. Don't let anyone talk you out of it.

If you get there and they want to send you home but you're still worried, *insist on staying.* You are allowed to advocate for yourself. You can say, "I understand I'm not far enough along by the numbers, but something doesn't feel right and I'd like to be monitored." A good care team will take that seriously.

This is especially true for decreased fetal movement. If your baby's kick patterns have changed, if they're quieter than usual, or if you just feel like something is different — don't sit at home timing kicks and hoping for the best. Go in. Let them put you on the monitor. Let them check. It is always, always better to be the woman who "came in for nothing" than to ignore a warning sign.

And if you've already been sent home once but the feeling persists, go back. There is no limit on how many times you're allowed to show up at labor and delivery. You are not being dramatic. You are not wasting anyone's time.

At the end of the day, the only thing that truly matters is a healthy mother and a healthy baby. Everything else — the birth plan, the timing, the "right" amount of dilation — is secondary to that. Trust your instincts. They exist for a reason.

#line(length: 100%)

== KEY TAKEAWAYS

The hospital admission process can feel like a lot, but remember:

1. _Triage is just an assessment._ Being sent home isn't failure—it might be the best thing for your labor.

2. _You have choices._ Standard procedures are recommendations, not requirements. Ask questions and understand your options.

3. _Set the tone you want._ The first hour establishes expectations. Be calm, clear, and kind.

4. _Build your team._ Your nurse is your ally. Invest in that relationship.

5. _Different admissions require different approaches._ Know what to expect whether you're in spontaneous labor, being induced, or having a planned cesarean.

6. _Preparation pays off._ Pre-register, pack smart, tour the hospital, and know the logistics ahead of time.

7. _Your partner handles everything but labor._ She focuses on the marathon. The partner protects, advocates, and manages every other detail.

8. _Trust your instincts._ If something feels wrong, go in. If they want to send you home and you're not comfortable, insist on staying. A healthy mother and healthy baby are all that matters.

You're about to meet your baby. The admission process is just the doorway to that incredible moment. Walk through it feeling informed, empowered, and ready.
