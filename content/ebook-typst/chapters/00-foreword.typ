= Foreword <ch-foreword>

When I found out I was pregnant, I did what most women do: I panicked a little, cried a lot (happy tears), and then immediately started googling everything.

That lasted about forty-eight hours before I wanted to throw my phone into the ocean.

Everyone had advice. My mom told me what her doctor said in 1987. My best friend swore by her birth center experience. The internet told me I was going to die if I didn't get an epidural, and also that I was going to die if I did. The hospital's childbirth class was four hours of PowerPoint slides that somehow managed to cover nothing useful. Every book I picked up had an angle — either so crunchy it made me feel guilty for considering a hospital, or so clinical it read like a liability waiver.

I'm a lawyer. I'm trained to research and argue both sides. I still felt completely lost.

And honestly? I didn't want to deal with it. I knew the baby was coming, obviously. But thinking about the actual _birth_ — the process, the decisions, the what-ifs — that was something I kept putting off. I ate well, went to my appointments, handled the pregnancy stuff. The labor and delivery part? I figured we'd cross that bridge when we got there.

My husband had other plans.

He started looking into things early on — reading, asking questions, bringing me information he'd found. I'd half-listen while trying not to think about the fact that a human being was eventually going to exit my body. But the things he was finding were hard to ignore — information I'd never heard from any of our providers.

He wanted us to take a Bradley Method course together. I was not enthusiastic. Eight weeks of classes, while pregnant, when I was already exhausted — it felt like a lot. I went because he asked, and I'm grateful I did. That course changed everything for both of us. It taught us how birth actually works, what our bodies are designed to do, and how much we didn't know. Looking back, we may have started the course a little early in the pregnancy, but the extra preparation time turned out to be a gift.

After the course, things got serious. We started creating our birth plan and realized how many decisions were in front of us that we hadn't thought about. That sent us down a much deeper path — reading books, researching online, reading studies, talking to our providers. He'd bring me what he found, we'd talk it through, and we'd make decisions together. As a lawyer, I pushed back, asked hard questions, and poked holes in his conclusions. We didn't agree on everything right away. But we worked through every decision as a team — and by the time I went into labor, we understood our options and knew what we wanted.

There are a lot of great books out there on pregnancy and birth, and some of them cover individual topics in more depth than this one does. But we never found anything this consolidated — one resource with the goal of laying out the pros and cons for every major decision, equipping you to make informed choices in one place. We were always comparing different books, articles, and studies to piece together what we needed. We wanted something that did that work for you.

That's what this book is.

We chose an unmedicated hospital birth, and that's what we got. Hardest thing I've ever done. I would do it again without hesitation.

I don't believe I could have done it without my husband. He wasn't watching from the sidelines — he was with me through the whole thing, supporting me through every contraction, communicating with our nurses, advocating for our plan when I couldn't speak for myself. We had talked through every decision before the contractions started. We'd written a birth plan. We'd brought questions to every appointment. When a nurse or doctor suggested something, it wasn't the first time we were hearing about it. We already knew the pros, the cons, and what we wanted.

The goal was always simple: healthy baby, healthy mom. We got both. And the most wonderful, precious baby we could have imagined. That outcome wasn't an accident. It was the result of months of preparation, done together. Instead of going with the flow and letting it all happen _to_ us, we were active participants in every part of the process. Informed consent meant something to us because we'd done the work to be informed. Whatever kind of birth you're planning, that preparation matters.

The more we learned, the more amazed we were.

The female body is _extraordinary_. The way your body knows how to grow a baby, how to time labor, how colostrum changes composition in the first days to match exactly what your newborn needs, how skin-to-skin contact regulates a baby's temperature and heart rate, how the microbiome transfer during vaginal birth seeds your baby's immune system.

God really knew what He was doing. Every child is a miracle, and the physiology behind it all is incredible. Science is still discovering more, but what we already know is stunning.

Moms, you were built for this.

This book is the consolidated guide we wished existed when I was pregnant. It's not medical advice — we're not doctors, and we're not pretending to be. It's a consolidation of the research, organized as an actionable resource for normal people. Every claim is cited. Every major viewpoint is represented. Read what applies to you, skip what doesn't.

We'll give you the science, what your providers will tell you, _and_ what they might not know or might not share. Most of the decisions in this book are genuinely value judgments — there's no single right answer, and we present the options so you can decide what's right for your family. But for some topics, the evidence on what's best for a baby's health and development is pretty clear. When that's the case, we'll tell you. We're not going to hide behind false balance when the research points in one direction. That doesn't mean the "optimal" choice is always the right choice for your situation — there are always tradeoffs, and we cover those too. But you deserve to know what the evidence says, and we're not going to sugarcoat it.

#line(length: 100%)

The first days of your child's life are among the most important for their development. The decisions you make during pregnancy and birth matter. Not because there's one right answer, but because _your_ answer should be informed, intentional, and yours.

Whatever you decide on any given topic in this book, make those decisions thoughtfully. Talk about them with your partner. Bring your questions to your provider. Read the research. Then trust yourself.

This book is for you and your partner to read, discuss, and decide together. That's how we used the research that became this book — side by side, figuring it out as a team.

I'm glad my husband built this. I hope it helps your family the way it helped ours.

  Everything in this book started as a conversation between the two of us, trying to figure out what was best for our baby. We made every decision together. I just wrote it down. I hope it starts the same kind of conversations for your family.
