= IV vs Hep Lock <ch-iv-hep-lock>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

During labor, you'll likely have an IV catheter placed in your hand or arm. The real decision is whether it stays connected to a fluid drip (continuous IV) or gets capped off for use only if needed (hep lock). Each approach has genuine advantages—your ideal choice depends on your birth priorities, risk factors, and comfort level.

== WHAT IT IS

_IV (Intravenous) line:_ A catheter in your vein connected to a bag of fluids on a pole. You're attached to the pole and must wheel it with you everywhere.

_Hep lock (saline lock):_ The same catheter in your vein, but capped off instead of connected to fluids. It's flushed periodically to keep it open. You're free to move without dragging equipment.

Both provide quick access if you need medications or fluids later. The difference is whether you're connected to a drip right now.

== THE EVIDENCE

_Why hospitals want IV access:_
- Quick route for medications if needed (Pitocin, antibiotics, pain meds)
- Fluid administration if you become dehydrated
- Emergency access if complications arise
- Required for epidural placement

_Why continuous fluids aren't always necessary:_
- Healthy women can drink fluids during labor (see Eating/Drinking section)
- Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium, difficulty with breastfeeding due to breast engorgement
- One study found women receiving IV fluids had babies who lost more weight initially, possibly due to maternal fluid retention inflating birth weight
- Continuous fluids increase bathroom trips, which can be disruptive during labor

_The mobility issue:_ Freedom to move during labor is associated with shorter labors and less pain. Being tethered to an IV pole limits your options—walking, showering, using the birth ball, changing positions all become harder.

_When you actually need continuous IV:_
- GBS+ and receiving antibiotics
- Pitocin induction/augmentation
- Epidural (fluid bolus required)
- Dehydration or inability to drink
- Certain medical conditions

=== Why Some Families Prefer Continuous IV

Not everyone wants to go without the drip—and there are real reasons to welcome it:

- *Peace of mind.* Knowing fluids are running steadily can be one less thing to think about during labor. Some parents find comfort in seeing the drip and knowing their hydration is handled.
- *Already planning an epidural.* If an epidural is part of your plan, you'll need a fluid bolus before placement anyway. Starting continuous fluids early means one fewer transition to manage later.
- *Higher-risk situations.* If your pregnancy involves complications—preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, or other factors—continuous IV access with fluids already running provides an extra margin of safety.
- *Not concerned about mobility.* Not every laboring person prioritizes walking or showering. If you plan to labor in bed, use a peanut ball, or prefer staying put, the IV pole is a non-issue.
- *Hydration without the effort.* Labor is hard work, and some people have difficulty drinking enough fluids—especially if nausea is a factor. Continuous IV fluids remove that burden entirely.

== OUR TAKE

This is a genuine decision with no single right answer—both continuous IV and hep lock are reasonable, well-supported options.

_The case for a hep lock:_ Freedom of movement during labor is associated with shorter labors, less pain, and greater comfort. A hep lock gives you full IV access if you need it while keeping you untethered from a pole. You can walk, shower, use the birth ball, and change positions without managing equipment. For low-risk labors, there's little evidence that routine continuous fluids improve outcomes, and over-hydration carries its own concerns—swelling, diluted blood sodium, and potentially inflated birth weights.

_The case for continuous IV:_ There's real reassurance in knowing fluids are running and hydration is covered, especially during the exhausting work of labor. If you're planning an epidural, are GBS+, or have any risk factors that might require quick medication delivery, continuous fluids mean the line is already running when you need it. For parents who aren't focused on mobility or who find the IV pole easy to manage, the tradeoff may feel minimal.

Families who value freedom of movement and a less-medicalized environment tend to prefer a hep lock. Families who value the reassurance of continuous hydration, who are planning medicated births, or who have higher-risk situations tend to prefer continuous IV. Neither choice is more "natural" or more "safe" than the other—they simply reflect different priorities.

Worth knowing: if you start with a hep lock and your situation changes (epidural, Pitocin, dehydration), you can convert to continuous fluids at any point. The reverse is also true—if you start with continuous fluids and want to switch to a hep lock once you're well-hydrated, that's a conversation worth having with your care team.

Whatever you choose, this is your decision to make. Talk with your provider about which approach fits your birth plan, your risk profile, and your comfort.
