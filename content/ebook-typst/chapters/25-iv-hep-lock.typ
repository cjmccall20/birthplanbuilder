= Chapter 22: IV vs Hep Lock <ch-iv-hep-lock>

== THE QUICK ANSWER

During labor, you'll likely have an IV catheter placed in your hand or arm. You actually have three options: continuous IV fluids (tethered to a pole), a hep lock (catheter capped off for use only if needed, giving you full mobility), or declining IV access entirely. For low-risk labors, a hep lock provides emergency access without restricting movement, which research links to shorter labors and less pain. Continuous IV is appropriate if you're planning an epidural, receiving antibiotics, or prefer the reassurance of steady hydration. One concern worth knowing: roughly 70-75% of hospital IV supplies are made with PVC plasticized with DEHP, a chemical that can leach into your fluids and cross the placental barrier. A hep lock with minimal fluid minimizes this exposure, and DEHP-free supplies are increasingly available if you ask.

*Bottom line:* Each approach has genuine advantages -- your ideal choice depends on your birth priorities, risk factors, and comfort level. A hep lock is the evidence-based sweet spot for most low-risk labors: full access if needed, full freedom if not.

== WHAT IT IS

_IV (Intravenous) line:_ A catheter in your vein connected to a bag of fluids on a pole. You're attached to the pole and must wheel it with you everywhere.

_Hep lock (saline lock):_ The same catheter in your vein, but capped off instead of connected to fluids. It's flushed periodically to keep it open. You're free to move without dragging equipment.

Both provide quick access if you need medications or fluids later. The difference is whether you're connected to a drip right now.

== THE EVIDENCE

_Why hospitals want IV access:_
- Quick route for medications if needed (Pitocin, antibiotics, pain meds)
- Fluid administration if you become dehydrated
- Emergency access if complications arise
- Required for epidural placement

_Why continuous fluids aren't always necessary:_
- Healthy women can drink fluids during labor (see Eating/Drinking section)
- Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium, difficulty with breastfeeding due to breast engorgement
- One study found women receiving IV fluids had babies who lost more weight initially, possibly due to maternal fluid retention inflating birth weight #citation[1]
- Continuous fluids increase bathroom trips, which can be disruptive during labor

_The mobility issue:_ Freedom to move during labor is associated with shorter labors and less pain #citation[2]. Being tethered to an IV pole limits your options—walking, showering, using the birth ball, changing positions all become harder.

_When you actually need continuous IV:_
- GBS+ and receiving antibiotics — though "continuous" is misleading here. Each round of antibiotics typically runs for 15–30 minutes, and then you can be disconnected from the IV until the next dose (usually every 4 hours) #citation[3]. Between rounds you can move freely with just the hep lock in place. You do _not_ need to stay tethered to the pole the entire time.
- Pitocin induction/augmentation
- Epidural (fluid bolus required) #citation[4]
- Dehydration or inability to drink
- Certain medical conditions

=== Why Some Families Prefer Continuous IV

Not everyone wants to go without the drip—and there are real reasons to welcome it:

- *Peace of mind.* Knowing fluids are running steadily can be one less thing to think about during labor. Some women find comfort in seeing the drip and knowing their hydration is handled.
- *Already planning an epidural.* If an epidural is part of your plan, you'll need a fluid bolus before placement anyway. Starting continuous fluids early means one fewer transition to manage later.
- *Higher-risk situations.* If your pregnancy involves complications—preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, or other factors—continuous IV access with fluids already running provides an extra margin of safety.
- *Not concerned about mobility.* Not every woman prioritizes walking or showering during labor. If you plan to labor in bed, use a peanut ball, or prefer staying put, the IV pole is a non-issue.
- *Hydration without the effort.* Labor is hard work, and some women have difficulty drinking enough fluids—especially if nausea is a factor. Continuous IV fluids remove that burden entirely.

=== Declining IV and Hep Lock Entirely

The conversation is usually framed as continuous IV _or_ hep lock — but there is a third option: declining IV access altogether. Some women choose this, and it is a legitimate, informed choice.

_Why hospitals want IV access in place:_
- If an emergency cesarean is needed, anesthesia requires IV access immediately — establishing a line under time pressure is harder and slower.
- It is easier to place a catheter when you are calm and still in early labor than during active labor or an emergency, when veins may be harder to find and holding still is difficult.
- Certain medications — Pitocin, magnesium sulfate, some antibiotics — can only be delivered intravenously.

_Pros of declining:_
- Complete freedom of movement with no needle, tubing, or equipment on your body.
- No tape pulling on your skin, no awkward hand positioning, no worrying about bumping or dislodging a catheter.
- No exposure to IV materials (see the IV Material Safety section below).
- For women planning an unmedicated, low-intervention birth, it removes one more piece of medical hardware from the experience.

_Cons of declining:_
- If an emergency arises, an IV must be established under pressure — which takes time you may not have and is more painful when you are already in distress.
- Some medications simply cannot be given without IV access. If you need them, the line has to go in first.
- If you change your mind and want an epidural or IV fluids later, a catheter must be placed during active labor — when contractions make it much harder to hold still for the needle.

This is your body and your decision. If you are low-risk, have no GBS+ status requiring antibiotics, are not planning an epidural, and are comfortable accepting the tradeoffs above, declining IV access is a choice you can make. Discuss it openly with your provider so everyone on your care team knows the plan before labor begins.

=== IV Material Safety

Most women never think about what the IV bag and tubing are made of — but it is worth knowing.

Roughly 70–75% of IV containers used in US hospitals are made with PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plasticized with DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) #citation[5]. DEHP is what keeps the plastic soft and flexible, but it is _not_ chemically bonded to the material — it can leach out of the bag and tubing into the fluid being delivered to you #citation[6].

_Why this matters during labor:_
- DEHP can cross the placental barrier. It has been detected in umbilical cord blood, meaning your baby is exposed to whatever leaches into your IV fluid #citation[7].
- California classifies DEHP as a known reproductive and developmental toxicant under Proposition 65 #citation[8].
- Animal studies have raised concerns about endocrine disruption, particularly effects on male reproductive development #citation[9].

_Putting it in perspective:_
- For a standard labor with a hep lock and minimal saline flushes, your total DEHP exposure is modest. Saline extracts significantly less DEHP from tubing than lipid-containing fluids (like TPN or certain medications), so a simple saline lock is on the lower end of the exposure spectrum #citation[10].
- A hep lock with occasional flushes exposes you to far less material than hours of continuous IV drip running through the same tubing.
- The duration matters — a 12-hour labor is a one-time, short-duration exposure, not chronic daily contact.

_What you can do:_
- Ask your hospital or birth center whether they use DEHP-free IV sets. Manufacturers like B. Braun and ICU Medical offer PVC-free and DEHP-free alternatives #citation[11], and many hospitals are transitioning to them — but you may need to ask.
- If your hospital does not stock DEHP-free supplies, know that a hep lock with minimal fluid running represents a lower exposure than continuous drip through the same materials.
- If this concern is important to you, bring it up with your provider well before labor so there is time to check what your facility stocks.

This is a real concern backed by real science, but for short-duration labor use — especially with a hep lock rather than continuous fluids — the exposure is modest. Requesting DEHP-free supplies is reasonable, increasingly available, and worth asking about.

== OUR TAKE

This is a genuine decision with no single right answer—both continuous IV and hep lock are reasonable, well-supported options.

_The case for a hep lock:_ Freedom of movement during labor is associated with shorter labors, less pain, and greater comfort. A hep lock gives you full IV access if you need it while keeping you untethered from a pole. You can walk, shower, use the birth ball, and change positions without managing equipment. For low-risk labors, there's little evidence that routine continuous fluids improve outcomes, and over-hydration carries its own concerns—swelling, diluted blood sodium, and potentially inflated birth weights.

_The case for continuous IV:_ There's real reassurance in knowing fluids are running and hydration is covered, especially during the exhausting work of labor. If you're planning an epidural, are GBS+, or have any risk factors that might require quick medication delivery, continuous fluids mean the line is already running when you need it. For women who aren't focused on mobility or who find the IV pole easy to manage, the tradeoff may feel minimal.

Women who value freedom of movement and a less-medicalized environment tend to prefer a hep lock. Women who value the reassurance of continuous hydration, who are planning medicated births, or who have higher-risk situations tend to prefer continuous IV. Neither choice is more "natural" or more "safe" than the other—they simply reflect different priorities.

Worth knowing: if you start with a hep lock and your situation changes (epidural, Pitocin, dehydration), you can convert to continuous fluids at any point. The reverse is also true—if you start with continuous fluids and want to switch to a hep lock once you're well-hydrated, that's a conversation worth having with your care team.

Whatever you choose, this is your decision to make. Talk with your provider about which approach fits your birth plan, your risk profile, and your comfort.
