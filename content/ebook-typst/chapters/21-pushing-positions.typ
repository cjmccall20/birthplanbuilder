= Pushing Positions: What Actually Works <ch-pushing-positions>

When it comes time to push your baby out, your position matters more than most people realize. The position you're in can make pushing easier or harder, faster or slower, and more or less comfortable. Yet most women end up flat on their backs—the position that actually makes pushing hardest.

Here's what the research says about pushing positions, why hospitals default to one of the least effective options, and how you can advocate for positions that work better with your body.

== WHY POSITION MATTERS

Your pelvis isn't a fixed, rigid structure. It's designed to move and open during birth. Different positions can change the diameter of your pelvic outlet by up to 30%—that's a significant difference when you're trying to fit a baby through.

=== How Your Pelvis Changes Shape

Your pelvis has three main parts that can shift during birth:
- _The inlet_ (where baby enters the pelvis)
- _The mid-pelvis_ (the middle passage)
- _The outlet_ (where baby exits)

When you change positions, these dimensions change too. Squatting, for example, opens the pelvic outlet to its widest point. Lying flat on your back actually narrows it.

=== Gravity: Friend or Foe

Think about it: when you're upright, gravity helps pull your baby down and out. When you're on your back, you're essentially pushing your baby uphill. It's like trying to roll a ball up a slope versus letting it roll down.

This isn't just theory. Studies show that upright positions are associated with:
- Shorter pushing stages
- Fewer interventions
- Less severe tearing
- Better blood flow to baby

=== The Problem with Lying Flat

The lithotomy position—lying on your back with legs up in stirrups—became standard in hospitals not because it's best for women, but because it's convenient for providers. In this position:

- Your pelvis is at its narrowest
- You're pushing against gravity
- Your sacrum (tailbone) can't move out of the way
- Major blood vessels can be compressed, reducing oxygen to baby
- You have less control and strength in your pushes

Despite all this, it remains the default in most hospitals. Understanding why—and what alternatives exist—gives you the power to make different choices.

== UPRIGHT POSITIONS (Best for Unmedicated Birth)

If you don't have an epidural, you have the most options. Upright positions use gravity to your advantage and open your pelvis to its widest.

=== Squatting

_Why it works:_ Squatting opens your pelvic outlet by up to 30% compared to lying down. It's the position humans used for thousands of years before hospital birth became standard.

_How to do it:_
- Supported squat: Partner stands behind you, supporting under your arms
- Squat bar: Many hospital beds have a bar you can hang onto
- Deep squat with support: Hold onto the bed or a chair for balance

_Consider this:_ Most people in Western cultures don't squat regularly, so your legs may tire quickly. Practice during pregnancy if you want to use this position.

=== Standing

_Why it works:_ Uses gravity, allows movement, and you can lean on support for rest.

_How to do it:_
- Lean against your partner
- Drape yourself over the raised head of the bed
- Stand and sway or lunge during contractions

_Good to know:_ Many people find standing helpful early in pushing, then transition to another position as baby descends.

=== Kneeling

_Why it works:_ Takes pressure off your back, opens the pelvis, and is easier to sustain than squatting.

_How to do it:_
- Kneel on the bed facing the raised head, leaning forward onto it
- Kneel with upper body draped over a birth ball
- Kneel with one knee up (lunge position)

_Especially helpful for:_ Back labor, when baby is facing your front (posterior position). Kneeling and leaning forward encourages baby to rotate.

=== Hands and Knees

_Why it works:_ Opens the pelvis, uses gravity, reduces back pain, and gives your provider good access if needed.

_How to do it:_
- Get on all fours on the bed
- Drape upper body over the raised head of the bed or a birth ball
- Rock your hips during contractions

_Research shows:_ This position is associated with less perineal tearing and can help baby rotate into a better position.

=== What the Evidence Says

A Cochrane review (the gold standard of medical research) found that upright positions during pushing are associated with:
- A reduction in assisted deliveries (vacuum, forceps)
- Shorter pushing time (on average about 6 minutes shorter)
- Fewer episiotomies
- Fewer abnormal fetal heart rate patterns

The main trade-off noted was a slight increase in blood loss and second-degree tears in some studies—but many experts believe this is related to how the studies were conducted, not the positions themselves.

== SIDE-LYING (Great for Everyone)

Side-lying is an underrated position that works well for almost everyone, including those with epidurals. It's a middle ground between upright and lying flat.

=== Benefits of Side-Lying

- _Better than on your back:_ Your pelvis can still open, and you're not compressing blood vessels
- _Restful:_ You can relax between pushes without holding yourself up
- _Works with epidural:_ You can use this position even with limited leg control
- _Reduces tearing:_ Associated with less severe perineal tears
- _Good for baby:_ No blood vessel compression means better oxygen flow

=== How to Do It

1. Lie on your side (either side is fine; switch if you want)
2. Your bottom leg can be straight or bent
3. Your top leg is supported—by your partner, a peanut ball, or the bed's stirrup
4. During pushes, pull your top knee toward your chest or have someone hold your leg up

=== The "Exaggerated" Side-Lying Position

This variation opens the pelvis even more:
- Lie on your side with your lower leg straight
- Bend your top leg up toward your chest as far as comfortable
- Have someone support that leg, or use a peanut ball
- This position creates maximum space in the pelvis for baby to descend

=== When to Choose Side-Lying

Side-lying is particularly good when:
- You have an epidural and can't be upright
- You're tired and need to rest between pushes
- Pushing is taking a long time
- Baby is showing signs of stress (side-lying improves blood flow)
- You want to slow down pushing to reduce tearing

== POSITIONS WITH EPIDURAL

Having an epidural doesn't mean you're stuck on your back. You have fewer options, but you still have choices—and using them can make a real difference.

=== Your Epidural Options

_Side-lying:_ (Described above) Your best friend with an epidural. You may need help holding your top leg up during pushes.

_The "Throne" position:_
- Raise the head of the bed as high as it goes
- Sit upright, as if on a throne
- Use the squat bar or your partner for leverage
- This uses some gravity while still supporting you

_Semi-reclined with legs supported:_
- Head of bed raised to 30-45 degrees
- Legs supported in stirrups or by partners
- Better than flat on your back, though not ideal

_Hands and knees (sometimes possible):_
- With a light epidural or as it wears off, some people can do this
- You'll need lots of support and help
- Talk to your nurse about whether this is safe for you

=== The Peanut Ball: Your Epidural Best Friend

A peanut ball is a peanut-shaped exercise ball that fits between your legs. It's one of the most useful tools for epidural births.

_How to use it:_
- Lie on your side with the peanut ball between your knees and ankles
- The ball keeps your pelvis open even while you're lying down
- Switch sides every 30-60 minutes
- Can use during both labor and pushing

_Research shows:_ Using a peanut ball is associated with:
- Shorter labor (by about 90 minutes on average)
- Shorter pushing stages
- Fewer cesareans

Many hospitals have peanut balls available, but you can also bring your own to be sure.

=== Making the Most of Limited Mobility

Even if you can only move a little, small changes help:
- Ask to have the bed tilted to one side (not flat)
- Change positions every 30 minutes if possible
- Request that stirrups be positioned to allow your knees to come toward your chest
- Use the bed's adjustments creatively—your nurse may have ideas

=== Talk to Your Anesthesiologist

When getting your epidural, you can ask:
- "Can we keep the dose low enough that I have some movement?"
- "I'd like to be able to feel pressure and the urge to push—is that possible?"

A "walking epidural" or lower-dose epidural may give you more position options.

== WHY HOSPITALS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK

If lying on your back is one of the worst positions for pushing, why is it the default in most hospitals? Understanding this helps you advocate for yourself.

=== Provider Convenience

Let's be honest: the lithotomy position is convenient for the person catching the baby. They can see everything clearly, have easy access for interventions, and don't have to adjust their position.

This isn't necessarily your provider being lazy or uncaring—it's what they were trained to do and what they've done hundreds of times. But their convenience shouldn't override what's best for you.

=== Electronic Fetal Monitoring

Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is standard in most hospitals, and the monitors work best when you're relatively still and positioned a certain way. When you move around, the monitors may lose the signal.

However:
- Intermittent monitoring is an option for low-risk births
- Telemetry (wireless) monitors allow more movement
- Some position changes can be accommodated even with continuous monitoring

=== Liability Culture

Medicine has become increasingly defensive. Providers may prefer you on your back because:
- It's "standard practice" (even if not evidence-based)
- They feel more in control if something goes wrong
- They're less familiar with catching babies in other positions

But "we've always done it this way" isn't a medical reason.

=== How to Advocate for Alternatives

_Before birth:_
- Discuss positions with your provider at a prenatal visit
- Ask: "What positions do you support during pushing?"
- If they seem resistant, ask why and see if you can find common ground
- Put your preferences in your birth plan

_During birth:_
- Say: "I'd like to try [position]. Can we do that?"
- Have your support person remind staff of your preferences
- If told no, ask: "Is there a medical reason, or is this preference?"
- Try: "Can we try this for a few contractions and see how it goes?"

_Phrases that work:_
- "I've read that upright positions can help—I'd like to try."
- "I'm not comfortable on my back. What other options do I have?"
- "Can we use the squat bar?"
- "I'd like to try side-lying. Can you help me get positioned?"

Remember: You have the right to choose your position unless there's a genuine medical emergency.

== SPONTANEOUS VS DIRECTED PUSHING

How you push matters just as much as what position you're in. There are two main approaches, and they have very different effects.

=== Directed Pushing ("Purple Pushing")

This is what you see in movies: everyone counts to ten while the woman holds her breath and pushes with all their might.

_What it looks like:_
- Take a deep breath
- Hold it
- Push hard for 10 counts
- Quick breath, repeat
- Three pushes per contraction
- Start pushing as soon as you're fully dilated, whether you feel the urge or not

_Why it's called "purple pushing":_ Many people's faces turn purple from the strain of holding their breath while pushing forcefully.

_The problems:_
- Reduces oxygen to baby (you're not breathing)
- More exhausting for you
- Associated with more pelvic floor damage
- Can cause blood vessel damage in your face and eyes
- May not be as effective as following your body's cues

=== Spontaneous Pushing (Following Your Body)

Your body knows how to push out a baby. When you follow its cues instead of external commands, it's called spontaneous or physiologic pushing.

_What it looks like:_
- Wait for the urge to push (even if fully dilated)
- Push when your body tells you to
- Push for as long as feels right (usually 3-5 seconds)
- Breathe when you need to
- Grunt, moan, or vocalize if it helps
- Rest between contractions

_The benefits:_
- Better oxygen to baby
- Less exhausting
- May reduce pelvic floor damage
- Often more effective
- Feels more controlled

=== Why Did Directed Pushing Become Standard?

Directed pushing became common because:
- It speeds things up (slightly) in the short term
- It gives providers something to do
- It works with epidurals (when you can't feel the urge to push)
- It became the cultural norm

But research shows that spontaneous pushing is associated with:
- Similar or shorter total pushing time
- Better outcomes for baby (higher oxygen levels)
- Less pelvic floor trauma
- More satisfying birth experiences

=== What About With an Epidural?

If you have an epidural, you may not feel the urge to push. In this case:
- _"Labor down":_ Wait 1-2 hours after you're fully dilated before starting to push. This lets baby descend on their own.
- _Gentle guidance:_ Your nurse can tell you when you're having a contraction so you know when to push.
- _Avoid prolonged breath-holding:_ Push in shorter bursts with breaths in between.

=== How to Advocate for Spontaneous Pushing

- Tell your nurse: "I'd like to push when I feel the urge rather than being coached."
- Say: "I'd like to try pushing on my own before we start counting."
- If you need some guidance, ask: "Can you just tell me when I'm having a contraction?"

== HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR BETTER POSITIONS

Knowledge is power. Now that you understand why position matters, here's how to make sure you get to use positions that work for you.

=== Before Birth

1. _Choose a supportive provider:_ Ask about their approach to pushing positions at a prenatal visit. Providers who support physiologic birth will be enthusiastic about position options.

2. _Consider your birth location:_ Birth centers and home births typically encourage position changes. Some hospitals are more supportive than others—ask during your tour.

3. _Write it down:_ Include position preferences in your birth plan. Something like: "I would like to use upright positions for pushing and prefer not to be on my back unless medically necessary."

4. _Prepare your support team:_ Make sure your partner or doula knows your preferences and can remind staff if needed.

=== During Birth

1. _Move before you're fully dilated:_ Get into positions you want to try during labor. It's easier to stay in a good position than to move once pushing starts.

2. _Be proactive:_ When pushing is about to start, say: "I'd like to try pushing in [position]." Don't wait to be told what to do.

3. _Try different things:_ If one position isn't working, try another. You're allowed to change your mind.

4. _Ask questions:_ If told you need to be on your back, ask: "Is there a medical reason? What would happen if I tried a different position?"

5. _Use your support person:_ Have them advocate for you when you're focused on labor.

=== If You Get Pushback

Sometimes staff may resist position changes. Try:

- _Understanding their concern:_ "Can you help me understand why that position isn't recommended right now?"

- _Finding middle ground:_ "I understand you need to monitor baby. Is there a more upright position that would work with the monitor?"

- _Buying time:_ "Can we try this for 10 minutes and see how it goes?"

- _Being firm (if needed):_ "I understand your recommendation, but I'd like to try this position. Please document that this is my choice."

Remember: This is your body and your birth. You have the right to make decisions about your position—and to be supported in those decisions.

=== The Bottom Line

The position that works best is the one that feels right to your body in the moment. That might be squatting, or side-lying, or something you make up on the spot. Trust yourself, stay informed, and don't be afraid to move.

Your body was designed to do this. Give it the best chance to work well by choosing positions that open your pelvis, use gravity, and let you feel strong and supported.
