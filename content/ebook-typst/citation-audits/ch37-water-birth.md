## CRITICAL CITATION GAPS (MUST FIX)

### GAP #1: ACOG Committee Opinion No. 679 - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Mentioned at:** Lines 41 and 439 (twice without citation)

**Claim:** "ACOG considers laboring in water acceptable but calls giving birth underwater 'experimental.' This 2016 position—unchanged despite years of subsequent research"

**Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Full Citation Details:**
- **Document:** Committee Opinion No. 679: Immersion in Water During Labor and Delivery
- **Organization:** American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
- **Date:** November 2016 (Reaffirmed 2021)
- **PMID:** 27776074
- **DOI:** 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001771

**Key Content:**
- Immersion during first stage: "may be associated with shorter labor and decreased use of spinal and epidural analgesia"
- Second stage/delivery: "insufficient data... it is the recommendation of ACOG that birth occur on land, not in water"
- Calls underwater delivery "experimental" approach

**Recommended Citation:**
- American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Committee Opinion No. 679: Immersion in Water During Labor and Delivery. Obstet Gynecol. 2016 Nov;128(5):e231-e236. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001771. PMID: 27776071. (Reaffirmed 2021)

**Confidence:** VERY HIGH - This is a critical missing citation that must be added

**Where to Add:** Lines 41 and 439

---

### GAP #2: Hospital Water Birth Availability Statistic

**Claim (Lines 153, 378):** "Only about 10% of U.S. hospitals offer true water birth"

**Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (actually <10%)

**Sources Found:**
1. Research Brief from UNLV: "It is estimated that fewer than 10% of American maternity wards offer water birth as an option"
2. Comparison to UK: "Half of UK hospital maternity wards are equipped with pools to offer water birth"
3. Oregon State University research: Documents limited US hospital availability

**Recommended Citation:**
- Research citation on US hospital water birth availability
- May need to cite survey data or practice pattern studies
- Consider Listening to Mothers data or hospital capabilities surveys

**Confidence:** HIGH - widely reported statistic, though precise source unclear

**Where to Add:** Lines 153 and 378

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Strengths:**
- Chapter already has substantial citation framework (34 existing citations)
- Major studies correctly identified (POOL, Cochrane)
- Good integration of research and practical guidance
- Comprehensive coverage of safety concerns

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. **ACOG Committee Opinion 679 never cited** despite two mentions - MUST FIX
2. **Seven cost formatting errors** - all same-number ranges need correction
3. **Some existing citations may be too general** (Evidence Based Birth, AABC for specific outcomes)
4. **Hospital availability statistic needs source**

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Fix all seven cost range formatting errors
2. Add ACOG Committee Opinion No. 679 citation (x2)
3. Add hospital availability statistic source
4. Update cost ranges with 2026 data
5. Verify existing citation [2], [3], [10] accuracy
6. Consider replacing general citations [13], [14] with specific outcome studies

## CONFIDENCE LEVELS

**Existing Citation Framework:** HIGH (good foundation)
**ACOG Gap:** CRITICAL (must add immediately)
**Cost Data Accuracy:** LOW (multiple errors requiring correction)
**Overall Research Quality:** HIGH (major studies correctly identified)
**Implementation Difficulty:** MEDIUM (mainly formatting fixes + one critical citation)

**Recommended Minimum New Citations:** 2 (ACOG 679, hospital availability)
