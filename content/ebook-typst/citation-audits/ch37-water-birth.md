## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add ACOG Citation** (Lines 41, 439) - Critical for credibility given two mentions
2. **Fix All Cost Formatting Errors** - Seven same-number ranges need correction
3. **Add Hospital Availability Source** (Lines 153, 378) - High-impact claim needs verification
4. **Add Birth Center & Home Birth Cost Citations** - Multiple cost claims need 2026 verification

### Quality Improvements

1. **Add Specific Home Birth Outcome Studies** - Replace general citations [13,14] with specific research
2. **Add GBS Safety Citation** - Supports challenge to common restrictions (line 141)
3. **Add Dive Reflex Override Citation** - Important safety mechanism (line 80)
4. **Add International Practice Citations** - Supports normalization argument (lines 441-442)

### Style Consistency

1. Consider adding inline citations in "Our Take" section for repeated major claims
2. Consider cross-referencing related claims (e.g., dive reflex mentioned in overview and safety section)
3. Ensure temperature protocols consistently cite [10,11] throughout

## CONFIDENCE LEVELS EXPLAINED

- **VERY HIGH:** Claim directly quotes or summarizes specific, verifiable source
- **HIGH:** Claim aligns with well-documented research or established standards
- **MEDIUM-HIGH:** Claim is widely reported but needs specific source verification
- **MEDIUM:** Claim is plausible but needs verification or has hedging language
- **LOW:** Claim needs significant verification or may be outdated

## NOTES FOR AUTHOR

### Strengths of Current Citation Approach

1. Major research claims are well-cited (Cochrane, POOL study, qualitative research)
2. Clinical protocols appropriately reference professional guidelines
3. Physiological mechanisms have supporting citations
4. Good use of both research studies and practical guidelines

### Areas for Improvement

1. **ACOG reference is critical gap** - mentioned twice, zero citations
2. **Cost figures need systematic review** - multiple formatting errors suggest data entry issues
3. **Healthcare system statistics need verification** - "10%" claim is high-impact
4. **Some existing citations may be too general** - especially [13,14] for specific outcome claims

### Questions for Resolution

1. What is the original source for "10% of U.S. hospitals" statistic?
2. Should birth center/home birth costs be updated for 2026?
3. Do you want specific home birth outcome studies cited instead of general Evidence Based Birth resource?
4. Should international practice claims be supported with country-specific guidelines?
