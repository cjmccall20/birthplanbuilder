# Citation Audit: Chapter 07 - Eye Ointment

**Chapter file:** `/Users/coopermccall/birthplanbuilder/content/ebook-typst/chapters/07-eye-ointment.typ`
**Audit date:** 2026-02-08
**Current state:** Chapter has Key Sources section but NO inline citation markers

## Phase 0 Fixes Already Applied

The following fixes were completed in Phase 0:

### Fix #1: USPSTF Grade A Recommendation (Line ~108)
**Status:** FIXED
**What was fixed:** Rewritten to accurately characterize USPSTF Grade A recommendation without suggesting it's based on modern evidence or that it accounts for maternal STI status
**Current text:** "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives erythromycin prophylaxis a Grade A recommendation — meaning they recommend universal application for all newborns. They concluded that erythromycin is 'not associated with serious harms.' This is the strongest possible recommendation level, and it applies regardless of maternal STI status."

### Fix #19: AAP 2024 Link (Line ~213)
**Status:** FIXED
**What was fixed:** Corrected AAP Red Book link to proper URL
**Current citation:** `#link("https://publications.aap.org/redbook")[AAP Red Book]`

### Fix #20: CPS Archival Note (Lines ~58, ~217)
**Status:** FIXED
**What was fixed:** Added archival note to CPS reference acknowledging original statement is no longer available
**Current notes:**
- Line 58: "Most provinces no longer require it; Canadian practice has moved toward targeted rather than universal prophylaxis"
- Line 217: "Note: Original position statement has been archived; the CPS recommended targeted rather than universal prophylaxis."

**Claim:** "The AAP recommends that routine procedures can be delayed until the first feeding is complete or at least one hour after delivery."
**Matching Key Source:** American Academy of Pediatrics (2024). Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum Prevention.
**Status:** ✓ HAS MATCHING CITATION
**Action needed:** Add inline citation marker

### 1.3 USPSTF Grade A Recommendation (Line 108)

## Section 3: No Citation Needed (Logical/Editorial)

### 3.1 Editorial statements and reasoning

#### Line 11: Historical context reasoning
**Text:** "Before antibiotics existed, eye drops were a lifesaver."
**Reason:** Logical/editorial statement about historical importance

#### Line 11: Risk assessment for tested mothers
**Text:** "If you've tested negative, your baby's risk of getting this infection is essentially zero."
**Reason:** Logical inference from negative test results; follows standard medical logic

#### Line 15: Bottom line summary
**Text:** "Bottom line: Eye ointment is genuinely important for babies whose mothers have untreated STIs or unknown infection status. For low-risk pregnancies with negative STI tests and prenatal care, you're treating a risk that doesn't exist."
**Reason:** Summary/editorial conclusion synthesizing presented information

#### Line 27: Erythromycin advantages
**Text:** "Erythromycin works better against gonorrhea, offers some protection against chlamydia, and causes fewer side effects."
**Reason:** Comparative statement that could benefit from citation, but may be considered general pharmaceutical knowledge

#### Line 43: Fundamental issue statement
**Text:** "The fundamental issue with universal eye ointment is this: it treats a risk that no longer exists for most babies."
**Reason:** Editorial thesis statement

#### Line 45: Zero risk reasoning
**Text:** "If you tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and you're in a monogamous relationship with a tested partner, your baby's infection risk is essentially zero."
**Reason:** Logical inference from test results; standard medical reasoning

#### Line 45-46: Benefit-risk statement
**Text:** "Applying medication to prevent something that can't happen doesn't provide benefit, just side effects."
**Reason:** Logical argument based on risk-benefit analysis

#### Line 77-78: Parental meaning statement
**Text:** "For parents hoping for those first clear eye-to-eye moments with their newborn, this matters. Many describe gazing into their baby's eyes as deeply meaningful."
**Reason:** Subjective/experiential observation; "many describe" is anecdotal

#### Line 102: Risk-benefit summary
**Text:** "For a low-risk baby whose mother tested negative for STIs, you're accepting a potential microbiome disruption to prevent an infection risk that doesn't exist for your baby."
**Reason:** Editorial risk-benefit synthesis

#### Line 108-109: Bonding uncertainty
**Text:** "Whether temporary blurred vision meaningfully interferes with bonding isn't definitively proven. Bonding involves multiple factors beyond just clear vision in the first 30 minutes."
**Reason:** Acknowledgment of research limitations; general statement about bonding complexity

#### Line 131: Cesarean transmission logic
**Text:** "However, with a planned cesarean, the baby doesn't pass through the birth canal where transmission occurs. Some hospitals still recommend it 'just in case,' but the actual risk is essentially eliminated."
**Reason:** Logical reasoning about transmission route; "some hospitals" is general observation

#### Line 145: Risk characterization
**Text:** "Then your infection risk is essentially zero, and eye ointment prevents a risk that doesn't exist for you."
**Reason:** Logical conclusion from listed criteria

#### Lines 189-206: "Our Take" section
**Text:** Entire "Our Take" section
**Reason:** Explicitly editorial/opinion section synthesizing chapter information

#### Line 207: Repeated conclusion
**Text:** "The procedure itself is quick and likely not harmful."
**Reason:** General characterization/editorial statement

### 3.2 Practical guidance and instructional content

#### Lines 149-157: "What Replaces Prophylaxis" section
**Text:** Watch your baby's eyes, have a plan for urgent care, tell your pediatrician, be honest about risk
**Reason:** Practical guidance/common sense recommendations

#### Lines 161-171: Refusal language examples
**Text:** Birth plan language, hospital staff language, resistance responses
**Reason:** Practical communication templates for readers

#### Lines 180-185: Before birth checklist
**Text:** Questions to ask about state law and hospital policy
**Reason:** Practical guidance for readers

#### Lines 197-205: Decision framework
**Text:** "What makes sense" recommendations for different risk levels
**Reason:** Editorial guidance synthesizing chapter content

- USPSTF 2019: Covers Grade A recommendation (Fixed in Phase 0)
- CDC STI Treatment Guidelines: Should cover transmission rates, current prevalence
- StatPearls: Likely covers historical background and clinical presentation
- Evidence Based Birth: Likely covers side effects and practical considerations
- AAO Clinical Statement: Likely covers effectiveness data and current practice

**Potential gaps:**
- International policy documentation (UK, Canada, Scandinavia)
- US state law compilation
- Microbiome/antibiotic exposure research
- Infant bonding/developmental psychology research
- Antibiotic resistance surveillance data

### Suggested Additional Sources

1. **CDC STI Surveillance Reports** - For current epidemiology, resistance data, age-related risk

4. **State health department regulations** - For specific state law claims (WV, TX, NY, CA, TN)
5. **Neonatal microbiome research** - For antibiotic exposure and dysbiosis claims
6. **Infant developmental psychology** - For eye contact preference and bonding research

### Next Steps

1. **Add inline citation markers** for claims already covered by Key Sources (Section 1)
2. **Identify specific sources** for HIGH PRIORITY claims in Section 2
3. **Consider additional Key Sources** for gaps identified above
4. **Verify specific statistics** (percentages, dates, policy claims) before adding citations
5. **Review Phase 0 fixes** to ensure they remain accurate with full citation context

---

**Total factual claims identified:** 53
**Claims with matching Key Sources:** 3
**Claims needing citations:** 38
**Claims not requiring citation (editorial/practical):** 12

**Overall assessment:** This chapter makes extensive factual claims about historical data, clinical effectiveness, epidemiology, international policy, and US state law. While it has a solid Key Sources foundation, most specific claims lack inline citations. Priority should be given to clinical effectiveness claims, epidemiological data, and specific legal/policy assertions that readers may want to verify.
