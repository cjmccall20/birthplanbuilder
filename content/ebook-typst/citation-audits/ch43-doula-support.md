## 📊 STAT DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED

### ⚠️ HEMORRHAGE REDUCTION CLAIM - OVERSTATED

**Location:** Lines 89, 131, 294
**Claim:** "Prophylactic Pitocin reduces hemorrhage risk by about 60%."

**Verification Status:** 📊 STAT DISCREPANCY

**Evidence Found:**
- Cochrane review shows RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42-0.83) for blood loss ≥1000mL
- This translates to approximately **41% relative risk reduction**, NOT 60%
- WHO and ACOG both recommend prophylactic oxytocin, but cite ~40-41% reduction
- Source: [Cochrane PPH Review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6487388/)

**Correction Needed:**
Change "about 60%" to "about 40%" or "by approximately 40%" throughout chapter

**Lines to Correct:**
- Line 89: "reduces hemorrhage risk by about 60%" → "reduces hemorrhage risk by about 40%"
- Line 131: Same correction
- Line 294: Same correction

**Assessment:** This is a factual error that should be corrected. The actual evidence shows ~40-41% reduction, which is still highly clinically significant.
