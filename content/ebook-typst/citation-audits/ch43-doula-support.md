## SUMMARY OF CITATION NEEDS

### Immediate Priority (HIGH confidence, central claims):
1. Third-stage Pitocin efficacy (60% hemorrhage reduction) — WHO/ACOG guidelines
2. Postpartum hemorrhage as leading cause of maternal death — WHO statistics
3. Official recommendations from WHO, ACOG, AWHONN for third-stage oxytocin
4. State-by-state Medicaid coverage list verification (as of 2026)
5. Cesarean cost differential ($10,000-$25,000)

### Secondary Priority (MEDIUM confidence, supporting claims):
1. Stress hormones and labor progression research
2. Doula support for cesareans and VBACs
3. Cost ranges and pricing data (2026)
4. FSA/HSA eligibility verification
5. Employer doula benefit programs

### Lower Priority (LOW confidence or difficult to verify):
1. Etymology of "doula"
2. DONA/CAPPA founding dates
3. Future predictions about PPO coverage

**Auditor's Note:** This chapter has strong citation coverage for its core evidence claims (39% cesarean reduction, labor duration, satisfaction, etc.) through multiple high-quality sources. The main gaps are in:
- Cost data (needs 2026 verification)
- Policy details (Medicaid state coverage, FSA/HSA specifics)
- Some mechanistic claims (stress hormones/labor, positioning effects)
- Organizational/historical facts that should cite primary sources

The chapter appropriately distinguishes between evidence-based claims (cited) and practice descriptions (uncited), with clear separation of editorial perspective in "Our Take."
