## Already Cited (verified for accuracy)

### Citation [1] — 3-1-1 vs 5-1-1 Rule

- [x] **"The 3-1-1 rule is your primary guideline: contractions 3 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute each, for at least 1 hour. This timing better aligns with active labor than the older 5-1-1 rule, which often catches women while they're still in the early/latent phase."** (lines 16-17)

  - **Title:** Labour assessment programs to delay admission to labour wards
  - **Authors:** Leeanne Lauzon, Ellen D Hodnett
  - **Journal:** Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
  - **Year:** 2001 (updated 2009)
  - **Supports claim:** Yes - systematic review on delayed admission supports staying home during early labor

### Citation [2] — Emotional Signposts

- [x] **"Emotional signposts are just as important as timing. Early labor feels like excitement...Active labor brings seriousness...Transition brings self-doubt."** (lines 18-19)
  → Simkin, P., & Ancheta, R. (2017). _The Labor Progress Handbook_ (4th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. See also: Simkin, P. (2010). The emotional signposts of labor. _Journal of Perinatal Education_.

  ⚠️ **NEEDS REVIEW** - The Labor Progress Handbook is verified as a standard textbook reference. However, the specific "2010 Journal of Perinatal Education" article on emotional signposts could not be located. Simkin published work on labor trauma in JPE in 2011, but not specifically titled "emotional signposts of labor" in 2010. The emotional signposts concept is well-documented in The Labor Progress Handbook and is widely attributed to Simkin's work.

  **Recommendation:** Cite only "Simkin, P., & Ancheta, R. (2017). _The Labor Progress Handbook_ (4th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell." The emotional signposts are thoroughly covered in this textbook.

  ✅ **VERIFIED** - Core finding of the study

- [x] **"At 5 minutes apart, most first-time mothers are still in early labor (the latent phase). They may be only 2 to 4 centimeters dilated. Arriving at this point puts them on the hospital's clock: once admitted, staff expect to see progress at a certain rate. When that progress appears slow — because the woman is in early labor, not active labor — the cascade of interventions begins."** (lines 313-314)

  ✅ **VERIFIED** - Supporting rationale from study

- [x] **"A 2023 study published in PLOS One followed over 1,600 first-time mothers in Pennsylvania and found dramatic differences between early and later arrivals at the hospital.

## Corrections Needed in Citations Section

### Citation [2] - UPDATE:
**Current:** Simkin, P., & Ancheta, R. (2017). _The Labor Progress Handbook_ (4th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. See also: Simkin, P. (2010). The emotional signposts of labor. _Journal of Perinatal Education_.

**Recommended:** Simkin, P., & Ancheta, R. (2017). _The Labor Progress Handbook: Early Interventions to Prevent and Treat Dystocia_ (4th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell.

**Reason:** The 2010 JPE article could not be verified. The Labor Progress Handbook is the authoritative source for emotional signposts and is sufficient.
