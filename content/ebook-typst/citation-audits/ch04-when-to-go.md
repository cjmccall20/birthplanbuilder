### Citation [1] — 3-1-1 vs 5-1-1 Rule

- [x] **"The 3-1-1 rule is your primary guideline: contractions 3 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute each, for at least 1 hour. This timing better aligns with active labor than the older 5-1-1 rule, which often catches women while they're still in the early/latent phase."** (lines 16-17)

### Citation [3] — Early vs Late Hospital Arrival

## Notes for Reviewer

1. **Strong citation coverage**: This chapter already has 11 citations covering the major research claims. The existing citations are high-quality (ACOG, Cochrane, peer-reviewed journals, established textbooks).

2. **Gaps to fill**: The main gaps are in the "baby's role in labor" section (newer research on SP-A, catecholamines, cardinal movements) and the emergency warning signs section (clinical criteria that should reference ACOG bulletins).

3. **Conservative approach**: Many of the proposed citations are for claims that could arguably stand without citation (e.g., cardinal movements are basic obstetric knowledge, emergency signs are clinical standard of care). However, adding these citations strengthens the chapter's authority and gives readers pathways to learn more.

4. **Source quality**: All proposed citations are either systematic reviews (Cochrane), clinical practice guidelines (ACOG), peer-reviewed research, or established textbooks. No low-quality sources.

5. **Confidence levels**: Most proposed citations are HIGH confidence because they refer to well-established medical knowledge or landmark studies. MEDIUM confidence items are mostly practical/clinical guidance rather than research findings.

6. **Typst formatting**: When adding citations, use the format: `claim text here.#citation[N]` where N is the next sequential number in the citation list.
