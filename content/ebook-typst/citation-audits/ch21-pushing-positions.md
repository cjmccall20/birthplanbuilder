  → Russell JGB. Moulding of the pelvic outlet. _J Obstet Gynaecol Br Commonw_. 1969;76(9):817-820.
  DOI: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1969.tb06185.x
  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | **📊 STAT DISCREPANCY**: The claim states "up to 30%" but Russell's later 1982 research found 28% increase in pelvic outlet area when squatting vs. supine (1 cm transverse + 2 cm antero-posterior diameter increase). The 30% figure may be a rounded approximation or refer to specific measurements. Recommend softening to "approximately 28-30%" or citing the more precise 28% figure.

  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Known complication of prolonged Valsalva; well-documented in RCT.

  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Strong RCT on spontaneous vs. directed pushing.

### Contraction Crest Pushing

- [x] **"Your uterus is already doing a tremendous amount of pushing on its own during a contraction. By timing your voluntary effort to coincide with the peak of that involuntary force, you get maximum effect with less personal effort"** (lines 322-323)
  → Roberts JE. The "push" for evidence: management of the second stage. _J Midwifery Womens Health_. 2002;47(1):2-15.
  DOI: 10.1016/s1526-9523(01)00233-1
  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Physiologic principle supported by literature; well-established review article on second stage management.

### Labor Down Strategy

- [x] **"Labor down: Wait 1-2 hours after you're fully dilated before starting to push. This lets baby descend on their own"** (line 330)
  → Fraser WD, Marcoux S, Krauss I, Douglas J, Goulet C, Boulvain M. Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of delayed pushing for nulliparous women in the second stage of labor with continuous epidural analgesia. _Am J Perinatol_. 2000;17(7):365-372.
  DOI: 10.1067/mob.2000.105197
  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Landmark RCT on delayed pushing/"laboring down" for epidural births.

  **Note:** The original audit suggested Brancato 2008 as primary citation, but Brancato is an integrated review, not a primary RCT. Fraser 2000 is the more authoritative primary research citation for this intervention.

- [x] **Alternative citation:**
  Brancato RM, Church S, Stone PW. An integrated review of the literature: maternal position during the second stage of labor. _J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs_. 2008;37(5):615-621.
  **⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | "Laboring down" is discussed in reviews from this period, but I could not locate the exact Brancato 2008 citation in search results. The Fraser 2000 study above is the definitive primary research and should be the main citation.

### Historical and Clinical Context

- [x] **"Squatting... is the position humans used for thousands of years before hospital birth became standard"** (line 52)
  → Jarcho J. _Postures and Practices During Labor Among Primitive Peoples_. Paul B. Hoeber; 1934.
  DOI: 10.1001/jama.1934.02750510079047 (JAMA book review)
  **✅ VERIFIED** | Historical/anthropological documentation of birth positions across cultures.

### Electronic Fetal Monitoring

- [x] **"Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is standard in most hospitals"** (line 213)
  → Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Osterman MJK, Driscoll AK. Births: Final data for 2019. _Natl Vital Stat Rep_. 2021;70(2):1-51.
  **⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | The CDC vital statistics report exists and is correctly cited, but it primarily contains birth statistics data (3,747,540 births in 2019, preterm rates, etc.) rather than detailed information about EFM practices. This citation may not directly support the claim about EFM being "standard." **RECOMMEND**: Either find a more specific source on EFM prevalence, or soften the language to "commonly used" and cite standard obstetric practice guidelines instead.

### Walking Epidural

- [x] **"A 'walking epidural' or lower-dose epidural may give you more position options"** (line 201)
  → Comparative Obstetric Mobile Epidural Trial (COMET) Study Group UK. Effect of low-dose mobile versus traditional epidural techniques on mode of delivery: a randomised controlled trial. _Lancet_. 2001;358(9275):19-23.
  DOI: 10.1016/s0140-6736(00)05251-x
  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Major trial comparing mobile vs. traditional epidurals. Study found normal vaginal delivery rate was 35% in traditional group vs. 43% in low-dose mobile groups (p=0.04), supporting claim that mobile epidurals provide more options.

## Additional Context Claims (MEDIUM-LOW Confidence)

These claims represent clinical reasoning, emerging practice, or less-studied techniques. Consider whether to add citations or soften language:

- [x] **"Most women in Western cultures don't squat regularly, so your legs may tire quickly"** (line 60)
  → No specific citation needed, but could reference: Simkin P, Hanson L, Ancheta R. _The Labor Progress Handbook_. 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell; 2017.
  **✅ VERIFIED** | Clinical observation rather than research finding. Optional citation to Simkin textbook appropriate. Suggest keeping as-is with "Most women" hedging language.

- [x] **"When you move around, the monitors may lose the signal"** (line 216)
  → Clinical reality but not typically studied. No citation needed.
  **Status:** No citation needed | This is practical knowledge based on equipment limitations.

- [x] **"Telemetry (wireless) monitors allow more movement"** (line 219)
  → Technology description rather than outcome claim. No citation needed.
  **Status:** No citation needed | Equipment description.

- [x] **"Directed pushing became common because: It speeds things up (slightly) in the short term, It gives providers something to do, It works with epidurals..."** (lines 301-305)
  → Roberts JE. The "push" for evidence: management of the second stage. _J Midwifery Womens Health_. 2002;47(1):2-15.
  DOI: 10.1016/s1526-9523(01)00233-1
  **✅ VERIFIED (DOI)** | Historical/cultural analysis of directed pushing practice. Roberts review addresses the evolution of this practice.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS — ACTION REQUIRED

### 📊 Statistical Discrepancies Found

1. **Russell pelvic outlet claim (Lines 11 & 52)**: Text claims "up to 30%" but research shows 28% increase. **Action:** Revise to "approximately 28%" or "nearly 30%" for accuracy.

2. **Peanut ball labor duration (Lines 180-183)**: Text claims "90 minutes shorter" but the cited 2015 Tussey RCT found only 29 minutes shorter in first stage + 11 minutes in second stage. **Action:** MUST revise text to reflect accurate 2015 study findings (29 min + 11 min) or note that 90-minute finding was from earlier 2011 pilot study.

3. **Electronic fetal monitoring claim (Line 213)**: Martin 2021 CDC report doesn't specifically address EFM prevalence. **Action:** Find alternative citation (ACOG guidelines, hospital practice surveys) or soften language.

### ✅ Strengths

1. The chapter references the major Cochrane review (Gupta 2017) which comprehensively covers upright position claims
2. All major claims are well-supported by high-quality evidence (RCTs, systematic reviews, Cochrane reviews)
3. Appropriate hedging language used throughout ("associated with," "may," "often")
4. Citations span classic foundational research (Russell 1969, Humphrey 1973, Jarcho 1934) through current evidence (Gupta 2017)

### 📋 Recommendations

1. **Priority citations to add:** Gupta 2017 (Cochrane), Tussey 2015 (peanut ball), Prins 2011 (spontaneous pushing), Russell 1969 (pelvic dimensions), Humphrey 1973 (supine positioning)

2. **Text revisions required:**
   - Line 11 & 52: Change "30%" to "28%" or "approximately 28-30%"
   - Lines 180-183: Correct peanut ball statistics to match 2015 study (29 min + 11 min, not 90 min)
   - Line 213: Revise EFM claim or find supporting citation

3. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Consider adding recent systematic reviews on perineal trauma and positioning (Lodge & Haith-Cooper 2016 found in searches)
   - Could strengthen hands-and-knees position evidence with additional sources
