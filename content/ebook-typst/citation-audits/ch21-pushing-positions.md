## Additional Context Claims (MEDIUM-LOW Confidence)

These claims represent clinical reasoning, emerging practice, or less-studied techniques. Consider whether to add citations or soften language:

- [ ] **"Most women in Western cultures don't squat regularly, so your legs may tire quickly"** (line 60)
  → No specific citation needed, but could reference: Simkin P, Ancheta R. _The Labor Progress Handbook_. 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell; 2017.
  Confidence: LOW | Clinical observation rather than research finding. Could soften to "Many women find..." if preferred.

- [ ] **"When you move around, the monitors may lose the signal"** (line 216)
  → Clinical reality but not typically studied. No citation needed.
  Confidence: N/A | This is practical knowledge.

- [ ] **"Telemetry (wireless) monitors allow more movement"** (line 219)
  → Technology description rather than outcome claim. No citation needed.
  Confidence: N/A | Equipment description.

- [ ] **"Directed pushing became common because: It speeds things up (slightly) in the short term, It gives providers something to do, It works with epidurals..."** (lines 301-305)
  → Historical/cultural analysis rather than research claim. Could cite: Roberts J. The "push" for evidence: management of the second stage. _J Midwifery Womens Health_. 2002;47(1):2-15.
  Confidence: MEDIUM | More of a historical analysis than a research finding.

## Notes for Review

### Strengths
1. The chapter references a major Cochrane review (Gupta 2017) which covers most upright position claims
2. Claims are generally well-supported by mainstream obstetric literature
3. Appropriate hedging language used in many places ("associated with," "may," "often")

### Recommendations
1. **Priority citations:** Cochrane review (Gupta 2017), peanut ball study (Tussey 2015), directed vs. spontaneous pushing studies (Prins 2011, Bloom 2006)
2. **Consider adding:** More recent studies on side-lying position outcomes
3. **Contraction crest pushing:** This technique is less studied in formal literature. The description is based on physiologic principles. Consider softening language slightly or noting it's based on physiologic reasoning if research is limited.
4. **Historical claims:** The claim about squatting being used "for thousands of years" could be supported by anthropological sources (Jarcho 1934 or similar)

### Potential Language Adjustments
- Line 94: "Research shows" could specify source or change to "Studies suggest"
- Line 52: "Thousands of years" is accurate but could add citation to anthropological literature
- Lines 322-323: Contraction crest pushing explanation is physiologically sound but may lack robust RCT evidence—consider noting this is based on physiologic principles

### Cost Figures
- No cost figures in this chapter to audit
