- **Reason:** Editorial assessment of practical outcome

### Line 43: "They trigger a predictable sequence"

## Summary Statistics

**Total claims analyzed:** 87

**Already cited properly:** 23
- Lines with inline citations that appear accurate: 9, 48, 52, 66, 79-81, 104, 158, 216, 227

**Need citations added:** 37
- Missing inline citations for specific statistics: 5, 11, 15, 29, 50, 54, 58-60, 66, 76, 89, 91-92, 116, 129, 132, 138-139, 144-149, 153-154, 158, 165, 175, 177, 233, 234

**No citation needed:** 27
- Editorial statements, physiological facts, clinical descriptions, advisory content, "Our Take" section

**Issues requiring attention:**
1. Math discrepancy at line 54 (3.6x vs 38%/16%)
2. Two bibliography entries ([13], [14]) never referenced in text
3. Several high-confidence statistics missing sources but likely available in ACOG bulletins or Cochrane review

---

## Recommendations for Author

1. **Immediate fixes:**
   - Add [10] at line 50 (posterior position claim)
   - Add [3] at line 29 (ACOG maternal request policy)
   - Add [1] at line 89 (Cochrane review mention)
   - Fix math at line 54 OR find correct statistics
   - Decide on [13] and [14]: use them or remove them

2. **High-priority additions:**
   - Cite hypotension statistics (line 132)
   - Cite dural puncture rates (lines 138-139)
   - Cite rare complication rates (lines 144-149)
   - Cite pain distribution percentages (lines 91-92)

3. **Medium-priority additions:**
   - Epidural usage rate (line 5)
   - Instrumental delivery rate and ratio (lines 11, 54)
   - Labor duration statistics (line 153)
   - Pushing duration statistics (lines 233-234)

4. **Consider:**
   - Is the "satisfaction/support" quote (line 116) important enough to track down exact source?
   - Should tearing claim (line 129) be softened or cited?
   - Are fentanyl pharmacokinetics (lines 76, 165) worth citing specifically or accept as standard medical knowledge?

**Overall assessment:** Chapter is well-cited with 14 references covering major claims. Primary gaps are in specific statistics that appear in "full picture" sections. Most missing citations are likely available in the existing bibliography sources (especially ACOG bulletin [3] and Cochrane review [1]).
