# Citation Audit: Chapter 05 — Fetal Monitoring

**Chapter:** Fetal Monitoring: Continuous vs. Intermittent
**File:** `/Users/coopermccall/birthplanbuilder/content/ebook-typst/chapters/05-fetal-monitoring.typ`
**Current State:** Has Key Sources section but NO inline citation markers
**Phase 0 Fixes Applied:** Yes (defensive medicine claim line ~62, author attribution correction line ~332)

---

## Fixed in Phase 0

### 1. Defensive Medicine Claim (Line 62)
**Original Issue:** Claim about defensive medicine needed more specific attribution
**Fix Applied:** Added proper citation to Localio et al. (Medical Care, 1997) research on malpractice claim rates correlating with cesarean delivery and intervention rates
**Current Status:** Now properly attributes defensive medicine finding to published research

### 2. Author Attribution (Line 332)
**Original Issue:** Author listed as "Patel"
**Fix Applied:** Corrected to "Arnold J, Gawrys BL" for AAFP Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring Guidelines
**Current Status:** Author names now match the actual publication

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Verify Existing Key Sources
1. Confirm all statistics attributed to Cochrane Review are accurate (63% cesarean increase, no CP/death reduction, 37,000+ participants, 13 studies)
2. Verify Arnold & Gawrys 2020 contains 99.8% false positive rate, observer variability data, NNT of 500
3. Confirm ACOG 2025 guidelines contain Level A evidence statement on >99% false positive rate
4. Verify Localio et al. 1997 findings on defensive medicine correlation

### Phase 2: Locate Missing Sources
1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Find Ethiopian 2024 study (16% vs 2% cesarean rates)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Identify scoping review with 81% increased cesarean risk finding
3. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Locate study showing 18% of cesareans for non-reassuring FHR patterns
4. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Obtain full citation for AWHONN 2024 Fetal Heart Rate Auscultation Practice Monograph
5. Find source for 21%/22% observer variability statistics
6. Find source for 85% Category II strips statistic
7. Verify 70% prenatal origin of CP statistic source
8. Find source for 1 in 500 CP incidence since 1985
9. Consider adding ultrasound safety reference

### Phase 3: Add Inline Citation Markers
Once sources are verified/located, add citation markers throughout chapter in format: `citation-marker[SourceAbbreviation]`

### Phase 4: Update Key Sources Section
Add newly located sources to Key Sources section with full bibliographic information and links where available

## Notes

- **Phase 0 fixes were appropriate:** The defensive medicine claim and author correction were both necessary and properly executed
- **Chapter is well-structured:** Clear progression from hospital messaging → full evidence → specific options → advocacy
- **Citations are clustered:** Most missing citations are concentrated in "The Cesarean Connection" and "The Problems with Routine Use" sections
- **Some statistics may be in existing sources:** Several claims (observer variability, Category II prevalence, 70% CP prenatal origin, NNT of 500) may already be in Arnold & Gawrys 2020 or ACOG 2025 — needs verification before seeking new sources
- **AWHONN 2024 is critical:** This recent monograph is directly quoted and should be added to Key Sources
- **Ethiopian 2024 study appears twice:** Same study referenced on lines 37 and 42-43 with same statistics
