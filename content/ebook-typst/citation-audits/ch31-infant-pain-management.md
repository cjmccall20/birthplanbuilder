## Overall Assessment

**Citation Quality:** GOOD with gaps

**Strengths:**
- Major research claims on acetaminophen-autism links are properly cited
- Cochrane reviews are appropriately used for breastfeeding and sucrose
- Lancet study on pain masking is cited correctly
- Phase 0 corrections successfully applied

**Weaknesses:**
- Several mechanistic claims lack citations (glutathione, opioid pathways, sucrose concentration)
- Organizational positions (FDA, AAP) referenced without citation to official documents
- Clinical practice recommendations (circumcision anesthesia) need authoritative sources
- Source [5] appears unused
- Forward references needed (breastfeeding claim at line 11)

**Estimated Work Required:**
- **Immediate (using existing sources):** 5 citations to add
- **Sourcing required:** 6-7 external sources to locate and cite
- **Cleanup:** 3-4 minor adjustments

**Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
This chapter makes strong clinical recommendations that should be backed by authoritative sources, particularly around circumcision pain management and organizational positions.
