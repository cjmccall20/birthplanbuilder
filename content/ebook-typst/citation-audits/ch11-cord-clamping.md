## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Add Inline Citations for Existing Key Sources
All 12 claims in Section 1 should get inline citation markers linking to the existing Key Sources. This is the quickest win.

### Priority 2: Critical New Citations (HIGH Confidence)
Focus on obtaining citations for the 15 HIGH confidence claims, particularly:
- Blood volume distribution statistics (line 33, 49)
- Iron content and timing (line 74)
- Global iron deficiency statistics (line 79-83)
- Iron deficiency risk multiplier (line 85)
- IQ deficit claim (line 91)
- 4-month iron stores data (line 96-99)
- Jaundice rates (line 131)
- Cochrane review on polycythemia (line 144)
- Blood transfer timing percentages (line 174-177)
- Nuchal cord prevalence (line 247)

### Priority 3: Supporting Evidence (MEDIUM Confidence)
The 41 MEDIUM confidence claims provide supporting context and should be cited to strengthen the chapter's credibility.

### Priority 4: Cost Verification
Verify that the cord blood banking cost figures (line 158) reflect 2026 US ranges as per project guidelines.

### Notes for Author

1. **Strongest areas:** The chapter has excellent Key Sources for brain development, preterm outcomes, official guidelines, and safety data.

2. **Weakest areas:** Need citations for:
   - Historical claims about practice changes
   - Physiological mechanisms (blood volume distribution, transfer timing)
   - Global iron deficiency epidemiology
   - Specific quantitative outcomes (IQ, ferritin levels, percentages)
   - Nuchal cord management and outcomes

3. **Dr. Alan Greene TEDx reference:** Consider whether to add this as a Key Source or cite the underlying research he references.

4. **Cochrane Review:** The chapter mentions "a major Cochrane review" but doesn't list it in Key Sources. This should be added.

5. **WHO guidelines:** Listed in Key Sources but not extensively cited inline despite WHO being mentioned multiple times.
