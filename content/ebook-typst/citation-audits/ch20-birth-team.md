**Reviewer Notes:**

This chapter has EXCELLENT evidentiary support. The Cochrane review on doula outcomes is gold-standard evidence and should absolutely be cited prominently. CNM regulatory and educational claims are well-documented through professional organizations. The few statistical updates needed (CPM legal status, cesarean dissatisfaction percentage) are minor and easily addressed.

The advisory content (interview questions, red/green flags, provider switching guidance) appropriately does not require citations - these are evidence-informed practice recommendations rather than factual claims.

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:**
1. Update the 3 statistical discrepancies noted above
2. Add DOIs for the 8 academic citations
3. Link to organizational sources for CNM/AMCB/NARM claims
4. Consider removing specific doula cost ranges or add regional qualifier
5. Update WHO bathing recommendation with 2023 guidance

Overall assessment: **HIGHLY CITABLE** chapter with strong evidence base.
