## No Citation Needed

### Definitional Statements

- "Certified Nurse-Midwives (CNMs) are a powerful middle ground" (line 9) — Definitional/framing statement

- "The choice between an OB/GYN and a midwife isn't about who's 'better'—it's about different approaches to birth" (line 22) — Philosophical framing

- "The core difference isn't skill—it's perspective" (line 30) — Editorial perspective

- "Neither approach is wrong" (line 46) — Value-neutral framing consistent with book philosophy

### Advisory/Guidance Statements

- "You can switch providers at any point—even at 36 weeks" (line 11) — Advisory statement (legal right, not requiring citation)

- "Your birth team includes everyone in the room" (line 12) — Definitional/advisory

- "Choose your provider carefully" (line 1015) — Advisory guidance

- "Trust yourself" (line 1023) — Emotional/advisory support

### Common Knowledge

- "Babies don't arrive on a convenient schedule" (line 619) — Common knowledge observation

- "Birth is intimate and you want privacy" (line 963) — Subjective preference statement

### Subjective/Experiential Claims

- "If your provider doesn't support your birth preferences or you feel dismissed, changing is almost always possible" (line 11) — Experiential observation

- "Women who switch late almost universally say one thing afterward: 'I wish I'd done it sooner'" (line 867) — Anecdotal observation (not presented as statistical claim)

- "Great nurses can make a huge difference" (line 1009) — Subjective experiential observation

## Notes for Reviewer

1. **Doula statistics are rock-solid**: The Cochrane review (Bohren 2017) is the gold standard and should definitely be cited. This is one of the strongest claims in the chapter.

2. **CNM regulatory claims are verifiable**: All claims about CNM licensing, prescriptive authority, and education requirements are well-documented through ACNM and AMCB sources.

3. **Cost figures need 2026 verification**: The doula cost ranges cited (lines 378-380) should be verified for 2026 accuracy.

4. **Intervention rate comparisons**: Claims about OB vs midwife intervention rates (lines 37, 44, 220) are generally supported but could benefit from specific citations to strengthen comparative claims.

5. **"Roughly 35 states" for CPM legality**: This number changes as states update regulations. Verify current count for 2026.

6. **Episiotomy rate benchmark**: The "under 5%" target is based on current low episiotomy rates in evidence-based practice, but specific benchmark should be verified.

7. **Provider switching claims**: Lines 787-791 about switching at various weeks are anecdotal rather than statistical. These don't require hard citations but should be framed as "many women report" rather than as verified data.

8. **Patient rights claims**: The HIPAA citation for medical records access (line 821) is straightforward federal law and should be cited.

9. **Philosophical claims**: Many statements about birth philosophy, provider approaches, and the medical model vs midwifery model are framing statements rather than factual claims requiring citation. These are appropriately presented as perspective.

10. **Interview questions section**: The extensive Q&A section (lines 401-702) is advisory guidance. The questions themselves don't require citations, though some of the "good answer" examples reference evidence-based practices that are already cited elsewhere in the chapter.

## Recommendation Summary

**PRIORITY CITATIONS (Must add):**
1. Bohren Cochrane review for doula outcomes (HIGH confidence)
2. ACNM/AMCB sources for CNM education and licensing claims (HIGH confidence)
3. ACOG guidelines for episiotomy and delayed cord clamping (HIGH confidence)
4. HIPAA regulation for medical records access (HIGH confidence)

**VERIFY FOR 2026:**
1. Doula cost ranges
2. CPM legality count ("roughly 35 states")
3. Current cesarean rate benchmarks

**CONSIDER SOFTENING:**
1. "CNMs are among the most rigorously trained midwives in the world" → "CNMs have rigorous training"
2. Comparative intervention rate claims (add "often" or "typically")
3. Provider time spent at delivery (acknowledge variation)

**TOTAL CITATIONS NEEDED:** 33 factual claims identified for citation
**CONFIDENCE BREAKDOWN:** 17 HIGH | 11 MEDIUM | 5 LOW
