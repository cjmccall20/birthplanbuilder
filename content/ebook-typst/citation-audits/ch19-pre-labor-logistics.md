## Executive Summary

**Total Claims Identified:** 6
**Already Cited:** 0
**Need Citation:** 1
**No Citation Needed:** 5

**Chapter Character:** This is a logistical/practical planning chapter with minimal medical claims. Most content is advisory, procedural, or common knowledge about pre-labor preparation. Only one medical claim requires citation (doula efficacy).

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ Strong — Only one claim needs sourcing. All other content appropriately presents practical advice without making unsupported factual assertions.

## Detailed Claim-by-Claim Analysis

### SECTION: WHO'S IN THE DELIVERY ROOM

#### CLAIM 1: Doula effectiveness

**Location:** Lines 183-184

**Text:**
> "Studies show doulas reduce the need for pain medication and cesarean sections."

**Category:** ⚠️ NEEDS CITATION

**Analysis:**
This is a specific claim about medical/clinical outcomes that requires sourcing. The claim references "studies" but provides no citation.

**Proposed Citation:**
Bohren MA, Hofmeyr GJ, Sakala C, Fukuzawa RK, Cuthbert A. Continuous support for women during childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2017, Issue 7. Art. No.: CD003766.

**Key Findings from Source:**
- Continuous labor support associated with increased spontaneous vaginal birth
- Decreased use of pain medication
- Decreased operative birth (vacuum, forceps, cesarean)
- Decreased cesarean birth specifically
- Increased satisfaction with birth experience

**Confidence Level:** HIGH — This is the gold standard Cochrane review on continuous labor support (doulas). It directly supports the claim made.

**Recommendation:** Add `#citation[X]` after "cesarean sections." where X is the citation number assigned to the Bohren et al. Cochrane review.

---

### SECTION: CHILDCARE & PET CARE

#### CLAIM 2: Labor duration variability

**Location:** Lines 11

**Text:**
> "Labor can last hours—or days."

**Category:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED

**Reason:** General medical knowledge. Labor duration varies widely and is common knowledge to anyone who has studied or experienced childbirth. This is an advisory statement about planning flexibility, not a specific statistical claim.

---

### SECTION: PRIVACY DECISIONS

#### CLAIM 3: Golden hour importance

**Location:** Line 141

**Text:**
> "Golden Hour: The first hour after birth is for skin-to-skin contact and initial breastfeeding."

**Category:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED

**Reason:** This is definitional, not a claim requiring proof. The text describes what the "golden hour" is (a standard term in birth settings) and notes its typical use. It doesn't make outcome claims that require citation.

---

### SECTION: HOSPITAL PRE-REGISTRATION

#### CLAIM 4: Pre-registration timing

**Location:** Line 234

**Text:**
> "Typically around 30-36 weeks pregnant."

**Category:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED

**Reason:** This is standard practice/procedural advice, not a medical claim. Hospital pre-registration windows are institutional policies, not research findings.

---

#### CLAIM 5: Insurance timing for adding baby

**Location:** Line 252

**Text:**
> "Added the baby to your insurance (you usually have 30 days after birth)"

**Category:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED

**Reason:** This is standard insurance policy information (qualifying life event window). The text uses "usually" to indicate typical practice. This is administrative/legal information, not a medical claim requiring research citation.

---

### SECTION: THE WEEK BEFORE

#### CLAIM 6: Term pregnancy timing

**Location:** Line 374

**Text:**
> "Starting at 37 weeks (term pregnancy), you could go into labor anytime."

**Category:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED

**Reason:** This is definitional medical knowledge. 37 weeks is widely recognized as "term" or "early term" in obstetric practice. This is standard medical terminology, not a research finding requiring citation.
