**Evidence Found:**
- Systematic review of 26 trials, 15,858 women

## Claims Requiring No Citation (5 items)

### 1. Labor Duration Variability
**Location:** Line 11
**Text:** "Labor can last hours—or days."
**Status:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** General medical knowledge about labor duration variability; advisory statement about planning flexibility, not a specific statistical claim

### 2. Golden Hour Definition
**Location:** Line 141
**Text:** "Golden Hour: The first hour after birth is for skin-to-skin contact and initial breastfeeding."
**Status:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Definitional statement describing standard term in birth settings; not making outcome claims

### 3. Pre-registration Timing
**Location:** Line 234
**Text:** "Typically around 30-36 weeks pregnant."
**Status:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Standard practice/procedural advice; hospital policy information, not medical claim

### 4. Insurance Timing for Adding Baby
**Location:** Line 252
**Text:** "Added the baby to your insurance (you usually have 30 days after birth)"
**Status:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Standard insurance policy information (qualifying life event window); administrative/legal information using qualifier "usually"

### 5. Term Pregnancy Definition
**Location:** Line 374
**Text:** "Starting at 37 weeks (term pregnancy), you could go into labor anytime."
**Status:** ✅ NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Definitional medical knowledge; 37 weeks widely recognized as "term" or "early term" in obstetric practice; standard medical terminology
