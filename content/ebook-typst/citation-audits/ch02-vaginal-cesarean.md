## Notes for Author Review

1. **Strong existing Key Sources**: The chapter already has excellent sources for VBAC, vaginal seeding, microbiome, and adhesions. These are well-matched to claims.

2. **Major gaps needing citations**:
   - Recovery statistics (Listening to Mothers survey needed)
   - Cesarean rate disparities by hospital type
   - Specific complication rates and surgical details
   - Breech version techniques and success rates
   - Labor physiology and hormonal benefits

3. **Highest priority additions**:
   - ACOG Practice Bulletins (ECV, herpes, delayed cord clamping, labor management)
   - Dominguez-Bello microbiome study (landmark paper)
   - Silver et al. on repeat cesarean risks
   - Guise AHRQ report on VBAC
   - Hansen BMJ study on respiratory morbidity

4. **Spinning Babies & Webster**: These sections rely on practitioner experience and limited research. Confidence is MEDIUM because evidence base is acknowledged as anecdotal/limited in the text itself.

5. **All dollar amounts**: None found in this chapter (good).

6. **Tone check**: Chapter maintains neutral, informative tone while advocating for informed choice. Aligns well with project philosophy.
