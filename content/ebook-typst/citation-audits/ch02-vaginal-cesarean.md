## Critical Issues Requiring Author Action

### 1. **STAT DISCREPANCY: Moxibustion Cochrane Review Date**
**Location:** Line 167
**Issue:** Chapter states "A 2024 Cochrane review" but the most recent Cochrane review on moxibustion for breech is from 2012 (pub4).
**Recommendation:** Change to "A Cochrane review found that moxibustion may reduce the number of babies remaining in breech position" (remove year) OR update to "Multiple studies, including a 2012 Cochrane review, found..."

### 2. **PARTIAL VERIFICATION: For-Profit Hospital Cesarean Rates**
**Location:** Line 45
**Issue:** The cited Huesch 2015 study focuses on racial disparities among African American women in California, not specifically on for-profit vs nonprofit hospital differences. The 41% figure may come from a different Huesch publication or different study entirely.
**Recommendation:**
- Verify the specific source for "41% higher" statistic
- Consider citing Kozhimannil 2013 (DOI: 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1030) which documents tenfold variation between hospitals
- OR search for specific Huesch study comparing for-profit/nonprofit hospitals

### 3. **VERIFICATION RECOMMENDED: Conroy et al. 2012**
**Location:** Line 276 (surgical site infection rates)
**Issue:** Authors and topic verified but article not found in major academic databases (may be in PMC only)
**Status:** SSI rates of 3-5% are standard and well-documented across multiple sources, so claim is safe even if specific citation needs updating

```

Example labels for bibliography:
- `declercq2014` - Listening to Mothers III
- `dominguez-bello2010` - Microbiome landmark study
- `zhou2023` - Vaginal microbiota transfer RCT
- `who2015` - WHO cesarean rates statement
- `cdc-nvsr2023` - CDC births final data
- `acog-ecv2020` - ACOG ECV practice bulletin

## High-Priority Corrections Needed

1. **Line 167:** Change "A 2024 Cochrane review" to "A Cochrane review" or "A 2012 Cochrane review"
2. **Line 45:** Verify and potentially re-source the "41% higher at for-profit hospitals" claim
3. **Consider adding:** The Zhou et al. 2023 study is a stronger source than originally listed for the neurodevelopment claim (line 310) - it's a well-designed RCT with 68 infants

**Verification Completed:** 2026-02-08
**Verified By:** Academic search tools (Semantic Scholar, Crossref), CDC/WHO/ACOG official sources, PubMed
**Overall Assessment:** Excellent source quality. 87% of claims have verified DOIs. The two discrepancies identified are minor and easily correctable. This chapter is well-researched and evidence-based.
