### Line 51: "Cesareans cost more than vaginal births (\$12,000-\$18,000 vs. \$8,000-\$12,000 in 2026)"
**Citation:** None explicitly numbered in chapter
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED

**Findings from 2024-2025 Data:**
- **Employer Plans:** Vaginal delivery averages $15,712; cesarean averages $28,998 (85% higher)
- **Uninsured Patients:** Vaginal birth $13,024; C-section $22,646
- **Out-of-Pocket:** Cesarean $3,071 vs. vaginal $2,563
- **State Variation:** $8,361 (Arkansas) to $19,771 (New York)

**Assessment:** The book's figures (\$12,000-\$18,000 vs. \$8,000-\$12,000) are LOWER than actual current costs. Real 2024-2026 data shows higher costs: vaginal ~$13,000-$16,000 and cesarean ~$23,000-$29,000.

**📊 STAT DISCREPANCY:** Book underestimates actual costs by ~$5,000-$10,000 per procedure

**Recommendation:** Update figures to reflect actual 2024-2026 healthcare costs:
- Vaginal birth: $13,000-$16,000
- Cesarean section: $23,000-$29,000

## PROPOSED NEW CITATIONS — VERIFICATION STATUS

### Line 49: "Cesarean rates range from 7% to 70% across U.S. hospitals—even for low-risk births"
**Proposed Source:** Leapfrog Group. Hospital C-Section Rates for Low-Risk Births. 2024-2025.
**Verification Status:** ⚠️ STAT DISCREPANCY

**Findings from 2024-2025 Leapfrog Data:**
- National average C-section rate for low-risk, first-time mothers (NTSV): 25.3%
- **Highest state rates:** Mississippi (28.9%), New York (28.3%), Massachusetts (27.8%)
- **Lowest state rates:** Nebraska (18.8%), Utah (19.7%), Idaho (20.0%)
- **Variation:** Approximately 10 percentage point spread between highest and lowest states

**📊 STAT DISCREPANCY:** The claim of "7% to 70%" appears to be an OVERSTATEMENT. Leapfrog data shows variation more like 19-29% at the state level. Individual hospitals may have wider variation, but not to the extent of 7-70%.

**Recommendation:**
- **Option 1:** Revise claim to reflect actual data: "Cesarean rates for low-risk births range from under 19% to over 29% across U.S. states"
- **Option 2:** Find source supporting the 7-70% hospital-level variation claim

**Recommendation:** Add citation: Grobman WA, et al. Development of a nomogram for prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery. Obstetrics & Gynecology. 2007;109(4):806-812. DOI: 10.1097/01.AOG.0000259312.36053.02

**Status:** ✅ Citation verified and recommended for addition

---

### Line 217: "Many hospitals ban or discourage VBAC despite ACOG recommending it"
**Source:** Multiple ACOG statements and VBAC access literature
**Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (contextually supported by ACOG PB 184)

**Support:** ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 184 (2017) explicitly states that TOLAC (trial of labor after cesarean) should be offered to most women with one prior low transverse cesarean. The bulletin acknowledges that many hospitals have restrictive VBAC policies despite the evidence.

**Recommendation:** Link to existing citation [1] ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 184

**Status:** ✅ Supported by existing citation [1]

---

### Line 225: "the U.S. performs roughly 500,000 more cesareans per year than evidence supports"
**Source:** Calculated from WHO recommendation and CDC statistics
**Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (mathematical derivation)

**Calculation:**
- U.S. births per year: ~3.7 million
- Actual C-section rate: 32.4% [CDC]
- WHO optimal rate: 10-15% [WHO]
- Excess cesareans: 3.7M × (32.4% - 15%) = ~643,000
- Excess cesareans: 3.7M × (32.4% - 10%) = ~828,000

**Assessment:** The claim of "roughly 500,000" is actually CONSERVATIVE. The actual excess is 640,000-830,000 depending on whether you use 15% or 10% as the benchmark.

**Recommendation:** Note in citation: "Calculated based on CDC birth statistics [9] and WHO optimal cesarean rate [4]"

**Status:** ✅ Mathematical derivation verified — claim is accurate (even conservative)

---

### Line 47-48: "'Failure to do a timely cesarean' is a common lawsuit accusation"
**Source:** Malpractice claim analyses
**Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (covered by Dubay et al. 1999 and Currie & MacLeod 2017)

**Status:** ✅ Covered by malpractice citations verified above

---

### Line 161: "Internal healing—the uterine muscle, fascia, and scar tissue—takes 3-12 months"
**Source:** Wound healing and ERAS literature
**Verification Status:** 🔄 GENERAL MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE

**Note:** This is standard surgical recovery knowledge. The ERAS 2025 guidelines discuss postoperative recovery timelines but don't specify exact internal healing timeframes. This falls into the category of general medical knowledge found in surgical textbooks.

**Recommendation:** Optional citation: ERAS Society guidelines [3] (already cited) or note as standard surgical recovery timeline

**Status:** 📚 General medical knowledge — citation optional
