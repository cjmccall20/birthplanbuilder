## NO CITATION NEEDED

### Lines 9-10: "cord prolapse, placental abruption, uterine rupture, complete placenta previa, and certain breech presentations are legitimate medical reasons"
**Category:** Medical definitions and standard-of-care indications
**Reason:** These are universally accepted emergency cesarean indications; definitional knowledge

**Category:** Standard medical indications
**Reason:** These are well-established medical indications found in any obstetric textbook; definitional knowledge

### Lines 88-93: Gray area questions to ask providers
**Category:** Advisory/guidance
**Reason:** These are suggested questions and critical thinking prompts, not factual claims

### Lines 100-127: Gentle cesarean options descriptions
**Category:** Descriptive/advisory
**Reason:** These describe available options and their rationale, not research claims

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Citation Coverage:** Strong (18 citations for a chapter this length)

**Citation Quality:** High — mostly peer-reviewed sources, professional guidelines, and authoritative data

**Gaps:** The chapter would benefit from 8-10 additional citations for specific statistics and medical claims that are currently unsourced (especially cost data, hospital variation, labor curves, placenta accreta risk, and ECV success rates).

**Verification Needed:** Cost figures for 2026 need verification or update with current source.

**Tone Compliance:** The chapter maintains balanced tone and respects patient autonomy while citing medical evidence appropriately.

   - Placenta accreta statistics (line 210) — Silver et al. 2006
   - Hospital variation range (line 49) — Leapfrog data
   - Cost comparison (line 51) — Healthcare cost data
   - ECV success rate (line 81) — ACOG
   - Classical cesarean rupture risk (line 83) — ACOG [1]

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Add citations for:
   - Friedman curve/modern labor research (line 57)
   - Malpractice pressure impact (line 47)
   - Fetal monitoring false-positive rate (line 92)
   - VBAC success >85% with favorable factors (line 201)

3. **VERIFY:** Update cost figures to confirm 2026 accuracy

4. **CONSIDER:** Add ACOG Committee Opinion on vaginal seeding to provide balanced medical perspective alongside the autonomy-respecting discussion
