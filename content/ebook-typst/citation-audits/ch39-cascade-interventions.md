# Citation Audit: Chapter 39 — Cascade of Interventions

**Chapter File:** `/Users/coopermccall/birthplanbuilder/content/ebook-typst/chapters/39-cascade-interventions.typ`

**Audit Date:** 2026-02-08

**Audit Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

**Total Factual Claims Identified:** 87

**Citation Coverage:**
- **CITED:** 34 claims (39%)
- **NEEDS CITATION:** 47 claims (54%)
- **NO CITATION NEEDED:** 6 claims (7%)

**Overall Assessment:** MODERATE PRIORITY

This chapter makes extensive factual claims about intervention rates, physiological processes, and research findings. Many claims are well-cited with inline links, particularly statistics from birthindueseason.org and studies from Evidence Based Birth and PMC. However, numerous specific claims about physiological mechanisms, typical hospital practices, and clinical thresholds lack citations.

**Critical Issues:**
1. **birthindueseason.org statistics (Lines 122-127, 273, 285):** Flagged for manual verification per Fix #18
2. **Physiological mechanisms:** Claims about how epidurals, Pitocin, and other interventions affect the body need supporting citations
3. **Practice patterns:** Many assertions about "typical" hospital protocols and provider behavior lack evidence
4. **ACOG guidelines:** Multiple references to specific ACOG thresholds need direct citations

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### One-Page Overview (Lines 7-13)

**Line 11: "When both Pitocin and epidural are used, 31% of first-time mothers require cesarean sections"**
- **Status:** CITED (inline link later in chapter, line 126)

## Verification Notes

### birthindueseason.org Statistics (Fix #18)

**REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION:**

The following statistics all cite birthindueseason.org and need manual verification against the source website/infographics:

1. **Line 122:** "32% experienced abnormal fetal heart rate changes compared to 17% who didn't receive Pitocin"
2. **Line 124:** "52% with epidurals had cesarean because of abnormal fetal heart rate, compared with 38% without"
3. **Line 124-125:** "33% of women with epidurals compared to only 10% without—three times more likely to have inadequate contractions"
4. **Line 126:** "When both Pitocin and epidural were used, 31% of first-time mothers required cesarean"
5. **Line 273:** "Women with epidurals are three times more likely to have inadequate contractions"
6. **Line 273-274:** "52% with epidurals had the procedure due to abnormal fetal heart rate compared to 38% without"
7. **Line 285:** "32% experienced abnormal fetal heart rate changes compared to 17% without Pitocin"
8. **Line 285:** "31% of first-time mothers require cesarean" (when both Pitocin and epidural used)

**Action Required:** Visit https://birthindueseason.org/cascade-interventions/ and verify each statistic against source infographics. Document verification or note discrepancies.

## Overall Assessment

This chapter has **moderate citation coverage** with room for improvement. The strongest areas are hospital variation statistics and birth setting comparisons. The weakest areas are physiological mechanisms and practice pattern claims.

**Estimated work to achieve 90%+ coverage:** 8-12 hours

**Priority level:** MEDIUM-HIGH

The chapter makes its case effectively with existing citations for major claims about intervention rates and outcomes. However, adding support for mechanistic explanations and practice patterns would significantly strengthen credibility and allow readers to verify core assertions about how interventions affect labor physiology.
