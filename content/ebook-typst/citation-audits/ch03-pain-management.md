## Section 3: Claims Requiring Revision or Removal

### REMOVE - Could Not Verify

1. **Line 91: "It takes about 15 minutes for the calming effect to begin [water immersion]."**
   - ❌ **UNVERIFIED** - No academic source found for specific timeframe
   - **Recommendation:** REMOVE specific timeframe or find source

### REVISE - Stat Discrepancies

2. **Line 51: Endorphins "10-30 times your normal levels"**
   - 📊 **STAT DISCREPANCY:** Source shows ~9-10x increase, not 30x
   - **Recommendation:** Revise to "10 times or more" or "up to 10 times"

3. **Line 113: Second stage "34 minutes shorter"**
   - 📊 **STAT DISCREPANCY:** Cochrane shows 6 minutes; Evidence Based Birth cites 34 minutes
   - **Recommendation:** Cite Evidence Based Birth specifically OR revise to more conservative estimate with caveat

4. **Line 273: Breastfeeding "82% vs 91%"**
   - ⚠️ **NEEDS VERIFICATION:** Could not locate these specific percentages
   - **Recommendation:** Find original source or revise to general association

### CLARIFY - Vague Attribution

5. **Line 249: "researchers note these time differences 'may be clinically negligible'"**
   - **Issue:** Vague attribution
   - **Recommendation:** Cite specific study or remove

## Section 7: Overall Assessment

### Strengths of Current Chapter

1. ✅ **Excellent evidence base** - Multiple Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, high-quality primary studies
2. ✅ **Appropriate skepticism** - Bradley Method statistics correctly attributed as "proponents claim"
3. ✅ **Balanced presentation** - Pros and cons of each method fairly represented
4. ✅ **Key statistics accurate** - Major claims (epidural fever, sepsis evaluation, etc.) verified with DOIs
5. ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - All major pain management options addressed

### Areas for Improvement

1. ⚠️ **Missing inline citations** - Need ~63 inline citation markers throughout chapter
2. ⚠️ **Minor stat discrepancies** - Endorphin levels (30x vs 10x), position duration (34 min vs 6 min)
3. ⚠️ **One unverifiable claim** - 15-minute water immersion timeframe (remove)
4. ⚠️ **Vague attribution** - "Researchers note" on line 249 (cite or remove)
5. ⚠️ **Industry sources** - Need disclosure for HypnoBirthing survey
6. ⚠️ **Data currency** - Epidural rate uses older CDC data; note limitation

### Citation Quality Score: A- (93/100)

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- Source Quality: 98/100 (Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, seminal studies)
- Source Accessibility: 95/100 (Most have DOIs; some need adding)
- Claim Support: 92/100 (Most claims fully supported; 3 need revision)
- Attribution: 85/100 (Needs inline citations; one vague attribution)
- Currency: 88/100 (Some data from 1997-2008 but still valid; newer studies included)

**Overall:** This chapter has **excellent evidence quality** with primarily high-level sources (Cochrane, systematic reviews, RCTs). The main work needed is **adding inline citation markers** and **minor statistical corrections**. After adding the recommended sources and citations, this will be an exemplary evidence-based chapter.

### RECOMMENDED (Quality Enhancement)

8. ✅ Verify breastfeeding "82% vs 91%" statistic or revise to general association
9. ✅ Clarify position/duration statistic (cite EBB for 34 min or use conservative Cochrane estimate)
10. ✅ Add note about Turner 2020 study context (argues epidural safe despite prolonged stage)
11. ✅ Consider adding visual/table of epidural fever rates by duration
12. ✅ Consider adding comparison table of pain relief options
