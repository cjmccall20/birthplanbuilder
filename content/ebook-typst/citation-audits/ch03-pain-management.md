## Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive Key Sources list covering all major topics
- Evidence-based approach with appropriate source types (Cochrane reviews, Evidence Based Birth, PMC research)
- Good mix of mechanism explanations and outcome data
- Appropriate attribution of advocacy claims (Bradley Method, HypnoBirthing)

**Weaknesses:**
- NO inline citation markers throughout entire chapter
- Several specific statistics without clear source identification
- Some medical mechanisms stated as fact without citation
- One vague attribution ("researchers note")
- Missing ACOG source that's referenced in text

**Estimated Work Required:**
- Add approximately 60-70 inline citation markers
- Add 5-8 new sources to Key Sources
- Verify 2-3 specific studies (2020 study, 56,000 women survey, Cochrane hypnosis review)
- Consider softening or removing 1-2 claims if sources can't be verified

**Overall Grade:** B+ (Good content and sources, but needs citation markers throughout)

## Methodology Notes

This audit identified factual claims by looking for:
- Specific statistics and percentages
- "Studies show" or "research shows" statements
- Medical mechanism descriptions
- Comparative claims ("more than," "less likely to," "increases risk")
- Historical claims (dates, origins)
- Policy or guideline references
- Time durations and measurements
- Outcome comparisons between interventions

Claims were categorized based on:
- Whether they match Key Sources listed at end of chapter
- Whether they require specific new citations
- Whether they constitute general knowledge or guidance
- The confidence level in proposed source matching
