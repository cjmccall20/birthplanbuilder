3. **AAP wet diapers** - 6 per day after day 4 (Line 30)
4. **Baby blues 80% prevalence** (Line 15)
5. **Heavy bleeding definition** - FIX TEXT to "two pads" then cite ACOG (Line 21)

### Priority 2: Add STANDARD CITATIONS (Should Add)

6. **AAP feeding frequency** - 2-3 hours (Line 14)
7. **Lactation timing** - milk comes in days 2-5 (Line 17)
8. **AAP baby warning signs** - comprehensive list (Lines 29-35)

## REQUIRED TEXT CORRECTION

**BEFORE CITING - MUST FIX:**

**Line 21 current text:**
> "Heavy bleeding (soaking a pad in an hour)"

**Should be corrected to:**
> "Heavy bleeding (soaking through two pads in an hour)"

**Reason:** ACOG defines postpartum hemorrhage warning sign as "soaking through TWO pads an hour for more than 1 to 2 hours"
