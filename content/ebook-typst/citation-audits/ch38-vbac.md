## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Citation Coverage:** EXCELLENT (Core claims verified)
**Verification Status:** 8 of 8 inline citations verified against primary or secondary sources

**Strengths:**
- Core statistics (success rates, rupture risks) verified and accurate
- Historical claims properly supported with dual citations
- Recent research (2025 calculator study, 2021 HBAC study) well-documented
- HBAC research appropriately cited with verifiable source trail

**Minor Issues Identified:**

- Some specific clinical outcomes (adhesions, recovery timelines, specific rupture percentages) lack inline citations but are verifiable

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add citations for adhesion rates (verified statistics, just need inline reference)
- Add citations for specific recovery outcomes and complication rates
- Add inline citation for direct ACOG quotes
- Support VBA2C and short interval statistics with inline citations

**Comparison to Other Chapters:**
This chapter has above-average citation density with 8 numbered inline citations plus a comprehensive Key Sources section. All major claims have been verified against primary or reliable secondary sources. The citations are well-distributed across major factual claims.

## CONCLUSION

Chapter 38 demonstrates strong citation practice with well-supported and **verified** core claims about VBAC success rates, rupture risks, and historical context. The existing 8 citations provide solid foundation and have been checked against primary sources. The chapter would benefit from approximately 5-8 additional inline citations to support specific clinical statistics (particularly adhesion rates, recovery outcomes, and precise predictive factors), but the overall scholarly rigor is excellent.

**Verification Confidence:** HIGH - All major statistics verified against primary or reliable secondary sources.
