# Citation Audit: Chapter 38 - VBAC

**Chapter:** 38-vbac.typ
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-08
**Total Inline Citations:** 8 numbered citations [1-8]
**Key Sources Section:** Present (lines 615-651)

---

## Executive Summary

Chapter 38 provides comprehensive coverage of VBAC decision-making with strong citation support throughout. The chapter includes 8 numbered inline citations covering success rates, rupture risks, historical context, calculator limitations, and HBAC research. Most major factual claims are appropriately cited. Additional citations could strengthen specific clinical outcome claims and benefit/risk statistics.

**Phase 0 Fix Applied:** Lines 85-87 contain softened language about VBAC calculator limitations per prior fix.

**Citation Density:** Good overall. Key sections (success rates, rupture risk, history, HBAC) are well-cited. Benefit/risk comparisons and some clinical outcomes could use additional support.

---

## Fixed in Phase 0

**Line 85-90:** VBAC calculator limitations language was softened from definitive claims to more nuanced presentation:
- "Research shows that VBAC calculators may overestimate success rates, particularly for induced labor [5]"
- "Studies have found significant gaps between predicted and actual success rates when induction is involved, suggesting the calculator does not adequately account for how induction affects VBAC outcomes [5]"
- Language appropriately hedged with "may" and "suggesting" rather than absolute statements

**Note:** Could cite [1] to cover these claims

**Line 107-111:** Blood loss and complications:
- "Lower blood loss: 200-500 mL average versus 500-1,000 mL"
- "Reduced risk of blood clots: 5-13 times lower than cesarean"
- "Lower risk of requiring blood transfusion"
- "Similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes overall"
- "Earlier breastfeeding initiation and better early nursing success"

**Proposed Citation:** StatPearls [1] or FIGO guidelines
**Confidence:** HIGH - Standard outcome comparisons

#### Multiple Cesarean Statistics

**Line 464:** "With two prior low-transverse cesareans, VBAC is still possible for many women. Success rates drop to about 50-72%, and uterine rupture risk increases to about 1.36%. ACOG states 'it is reasonable to consider TOLAC' in these cases"

**Proposed Citation:** ACOG Practice Bulletin and VBA2C literature
**Confidence:** HIGH - Multiple sources in Key Sources cover this

## Recommendations for Citation Strengthening

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Line 127-132: Adhesion Statistics** - Add citation for cumulative adhesion rates after multiple cesareans
   - Search surgical literature or cesarean complication studies
   - These specific percentages require direct support

2. **Line 167: Fetal heart rate warning signs** - Add citation for "70% of cases"
   - Likely in ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 184 or uterine rupture literature
   - Clinical presentation data needs direct support

3. **Line 100-111: Recovery and complication comparisons** - Consider adding inline citations
   - Could reference [1] or add ACOG bulletin inline
   - Blood loss volumes and blood clot risk multiplier particularly need support

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Line 319: ACOG quote on monitoring** - Add inline citation to ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 184
   - Direct quote requires direct citation
   - Source already in Key Sources

5. **Line 66-67: 85-90% success with prior vaginal birth** - Add specific citation
   - Could extend [1] or cite prediction studies
   - Strong predictor deserves direct support

6. **Line 156: 1.36% rupture risk with two prior cesareans** - Add citation
   - Specific statistic needs support
   - Likely in source [2] or related literature

### LOW PRIORITY

7. **Line 49: 1999 ACOG guidelines** - Consider adding ACOG historical guideline reference
   - Well-known historical fact but could strengthen

8. **Line 196: 14% VBAC attempt rate** - Could add emphasis citation
   - Striking statistic that reinforces access problem
   - Likely covered by [1] but inline would add impact

9. **Line 464-470: Multiple cesarean and short interval statistics** - Add supporting citations
   - VBA2C success rates and short interval rupture risk
   - Sources exist in Key Sources section

---

## Overall Assessment

**Citation Coverage:** GOOD TO EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
- Core statistics (success rates, rupture risks) strongly cited
- Historical claims properly supported with dual citations
- Recent research on calculator limitations well-documented
- HBAC research appropriately cited

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some specific clinical outcomes (adhesions, recovery timelines) lack direct citations
- A few precise statistics (70% heart rate changes, 85-90% success with prior VB) need direct support
- Direct ACOG quotes should have inline citations even when bulletin is in Key Sources

**Comparison to Other Chapters:**
This chapter has above-average citation density with 8 numbered inline citations plus a comprehensive Key Sources section. The citations are well-distributed across major factual claims. Most improvement opportunities involve adding precision citations for specific statistics rather than addressing uncited major claims.

## Conclusion

Chapter 38 demonstrates strong citation practice with well-supported core claims about VBAC success rates, rupture risks, and historical context. The chapter would benefit from approximately 5-8 additional citations to support specific clinical statistics (particularly adhesion rates, recovery outcomes, and precise predictive factors). The existing 8 citations provide solid foundation, and the comprehensive Key Sources section offers resources for readers seeking deeper information. Overall, this is a well-documented chapter requiring only moderate citation enhancement for optimal scholarly rigor.
