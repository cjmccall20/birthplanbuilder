## SECTION 8: CORRECTIONS NEEDED

### 📊 Correction 1: Author Name Error
**Current listing:** "Cho ES, et al. (2015)"
**Correct citation:** Beiranvand S, Valizadeh F, Hosseinabadi R, Pournia Y. (2014)
**DOI:** 10.1155/2014/846486
**Action:** Replace in Key Sources section

### 📊 Correction 2: Temperature Range Upper Bound
**Current text (Line 36):** "between 97.7 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit"
**WHO standard:** 97.7-99.5°F (36.5-37.5°C)
**Action:** Consider updating to "between 97.7 and 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit" for full accuracy, OR keep 98.6°F as conservative target (acceptable)

### 📊 Correction 3: 24-Hour Bath Delay Attribution
**Current (Line 99):** "recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggest delaying the first bath for at least 24 hours"
**Correction:** Primary 24-hour recommendation is from WHO; AAP supports delayed bathing but doesn't specify 24 hours
**Action:** Revise to "Current recommendations from the World Health Organization and American Academy of Pediatrics suggest delaying the first bath, ideally for at least 24 hours"
