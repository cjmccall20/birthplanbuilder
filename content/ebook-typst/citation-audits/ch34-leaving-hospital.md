## Key Findings

### Strengths of Chapter
- Practical, procedure-focused content
- Balanced presentation of early vs. extended stay
- Respects autonomy while providing clear information
- No prescriptive "should" language
- Acknowledges different needs (first-time vs. experienced parents)

### Verification Quality
- **Federal law citation:** Most authoritative source (Public Law 104-204)
- **Clinical guidelines:** AAP and ACOG recommendations well-documented
- **State requirements:** Universal hearing and metabolic screening verified
- All major claims have strong sourcing

### Minimal Citation Needs
This chapter requires relatively few citations because:
- Most content is either legal requirements or standard medical practice
- Many statements are advisory/observational rather than factual claims
- Core federal statute (NMHPA) covers multiple claims

### Recommended Minimum Citations
For minimal viable citation coverage, add:
1. **Line 42:** Federal statute (NMHPA) - CRITICAL
2. **Lines 14-15:** ACOG/AAP guidelines for stay durations - HIGH PRIORITY
3. **Line 31:** AAP policy on early discharge follow-up - HIGH PRIORITY
