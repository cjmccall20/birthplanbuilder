**For the author:**
- This chapter is very practical and procedure-focused
- Most claims are either:
  - Standard medical practice (needs guideline citations)
  - Legal requirements (needs statute citations)
  - Advisory content (no citation needed)
- The federal law citation is the most critical addition
- Consider adding 1-2 research citations if data exists on:
  - Early discharge outcomes by parity (first-time vs. experienced)
  - Patient satisfaction with different length-of-stay options

**Search strategy recommendations:**
1. Start with ACOG and AAP joint guidelines on perinatal care
2. Cite the federal statute directly (Public Law 104-204)
