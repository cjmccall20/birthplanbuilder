## POTENTIAL CITATION ISSUES

### Issue 1: Preterm vs. Term Infant Studies
**Citations [2] and [6]** focus on preterm/NICU infants but are used to support claims about routine newborn screening in term infants. While pain mechanisms may be similar, this should be noted or additional citations for term infants should be added.

### Issue 2: Journal Name Discrepancy
**Line 27** states "Research published in Frontiers in Pediatrics" but **Citation [2]** lists "Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal" as the publication. This needs correction.

### Issue 3: Extraordinary Claim
**98% crying reduction** (Line 58) is an extraordinary outcome that deserves specific citation to the individual study, not just the Cochrane review umbrella.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Verify all existing citations** match their claims (especially [2] journal discrepancy)
2. **Add citations for the four disease outcome claims** (PKU, hypothyroidism, sickle cell, SCID)
3. **Add citation for 1 in 300 detection rate**
4. **Add citation for timing protocol** (24-48 hours)
5. **Add citation for number of conditions screened**

### Secondary Actions:
6. Add specific citation for 98% crying reduction claim
7. Add citation for skin-to-skin pain reduction
8. Add citation for New Jersey 2024 policy change
9. Consider adding citations specifically about term infants for pain claims (currently rely on preterm studies)
10. Add citation for temperature-pain response relationship

### Style Consistency:
- Consider whether policy guidance statements (lines 49-52, 82-91) should include citations even though they're practical applications of cited evidence
- Ensure all state-specific retention policies are equally supported (California, Texas, Minnesota have citations; New Jersey needs one)

---

## CONCLUSION

Chapter 29 has **strong citation coverage for privacy concerns** (sources [3], [4], [5]) and **adequate coverage for pain research** (sources [1], [2], [6]), but has **significant gaps in disease-specific outcome claims** that form the core medical justification for newborn screening.

The most critical additions needed are authoritative medical sources for PKU, hypothyroidism, sickle cell, and SCID treatment outcomes, as these claims are central to the chapter's balanced presentation of screening benefits.

One citation error (journal name mismatch for [2]) needs immediate correction, and the preterm infant focus of pain studies should be noted or supplemented with term infant research.
