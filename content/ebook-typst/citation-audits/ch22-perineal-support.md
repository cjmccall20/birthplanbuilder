## Notes for Review

1. **Clitoral tear claim (line 201)**: This is a strong clinical claim about upward perineal tears. While anterior tears are documented, clitoral tears specifically are rare. The claim is accurate but consider whether it needs a more specific citation beyond general perineal trauma anatomy papers.

2. **Episiotomy rate threshold (10-15%)**: ACOG doesn't specify exact thresholds. National rates vary. Consider softening to "A provider with a low episiotomy rate is following evidence-based practice" or citing actual US national average (~12% as of recent data).

3. **Water birth**: The claim is already appropriately softened ("some research suggests"). The evidence is genuinely mixed, so the current wording is good.

4. **Recovery timeframes**: These are widely cited standards but vary by individual. Current wording appropriately uses ranges and qualifiers like "about" and "usually."

5. **General wellness advice**: Many claims about hydration, diet, comfort measures don't need citations as they're standard supportive care recommendations.

6. **Pain medication dosing**: The chapter doesn't provide specific dosages, only general categories of medications, which is appropriate for this format.

## Summary

This chapter makes solid, evidence-based claims throughout. The majority of factual assertions align with high-quality systematic reviews (Cochrane) and professional guidelines (ACOG, RCOG). Key areas with strong citation needs:

- **Epidemiology**: Tearing rates, severity distribution
- **Prevention**: Perineal massage effectiveness, warm compresses, positioning
- **Episiotomy**: Policy shift away from routine use, outcomes comparison
- **Recovery**: Healing timeframes, pain management effectiveness

The chapter appropriately balances research findings with practical advice and emotional support. Most "no citation needed" items are definitional, advisory, or descriptive of common practices rather than contested factual claims.
