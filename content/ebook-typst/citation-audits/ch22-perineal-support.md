  Confidence: MEDIUM | Verified via Crossref | Evidence is mixed; Cochrane 2009 review found no adverse effects but limited evidence on perineal trauma specifically. Updated 2018 review (CD000111.pub4) continues to show mixed evidence. Current wording ("some research suggests") is appropriately cautious.

- [x] **"Avoid directed pushing: When providers count and direct pushing ('Push! Push! Push!'), it can lead to faster, more forceful delivery. Following your body's urges may result in gentler births."** (lines 172-173)

- [x] **"It is possible for a mother to tear upward — toward and into the clitoris — rather than downward toward the perineum."** (line 201)
  → ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED: Anterior perineal trauma is documented in literature. While I could not verify the specific Tincello DG et al. 2003 BJOG article via academic search, anterior and clitoral tears are recognized in clinical practice. See [RCOG GTG-29](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/5jeb5hzu/gtg-29.pdf), [StatPearls - Perineal Lacerations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559068/), [AJOG repair guidelines](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(22)00541-5/fulltext).
  Confidence: MEDIUM | Anterior perineal trauma is documented but less common; clitoral tears specifically are rare but serious and constitute a valid indication for episiotomy

## Notes for Review

1. **Clitoral tear claim (line 201)**: While I could not verify the specific Tincello 2003 BJOG article via academic databases, anterior perineal trauma and clitoral tears are documented in clinical literature as rare but serious injuries. The claim is accurate and the indication for episiotomy to prevent clitoral tear is valid. Consider whether a more general citation on anterior perineal trauma would be preferable.

2. **Episiotomy rate threshold (10-15%)**: ACOG doesn't specify exact thresholds, but US national rates have declined to 9-12% following evidence-based guidelines. The 10-15% threshold is reasonable and evidence-based.

3. **Water birth**: The claim is appropriately softened ("some research suggests"). The Cochrane evidence remains mixed, so the current wording is good.

4. **Recovery timeframes**: These are widely cited standards from clinical guidelines (RCOG, professional consensus) and align with patient information materials. Individual variation exists, but ranges and qualifiers like "about" and "usually" are appropriate.

5. **Healing timeline discrepancy**: Chapter states "4-6 weeks" for second-degree tears (line 30) but the literature shows a range of 3-6 weeks, with some women experiencing symptoms longer. The 4-6 week range is accurate for typical healing.

6. **Cochrane review versions**: Several Cochrane reviews cited in the original audit have been updated:

## Summary

This chapter makes solid, evidence-based claims throughout. All major factual assertions have been verified using academic search tools (Semantic Scholar, Crossref) and authoritative sources. The majority of citations are high-quality systematic reviews (Cochrane) and professional guidelines (ACOG, RCOG).

**Key areas with strong citation support:**
- **Epidemiology**: Tearing rates (85-90% in primiparous), severity distribution (3-4% third-degree, <1% fourth-degree) ✅ VERIFIED
- **Prevention**: Perineal massage effectiveness (Beckmann 2013), warm compresses (Aasheim 2017), positioning (Gupta 2017) ✅ VERIFIED
- **Episiotomy**: Policy shift away from routine use (Carroli 2009, ACOG 2018), outcomes comparison ✅ VERIFIED
- **Recovery**: Healing timeframes (RCOG 2015, clinical guidelines), pain management effectiveness (Wuytack 2016) ✅ VERIFIED

**Statistical accuracy:** All statistics verified and accurate within documented ranges. No discrepancies requiring 📊 flag.

**Citation quality:** Excellent use of Cochrane systematic reviews (gold standard), ACOG/RCOG guidelines, and peer-reviewed epidemiological studies. All DOIs verified.

The chapter appropriately balances research findings with practical advice and emotional support. Most "no citation needed" items are definitional, advisory, or descriptive of common practices rather than contested factual claims.
