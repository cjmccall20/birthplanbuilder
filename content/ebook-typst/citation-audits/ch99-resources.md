## Verification Notes

### Resource Balance
The chapter appropriately balances natural birth advocacy resources with mainstream medical resources, consistent with the guide's stated philosophy: "resources representing multiple perspectives—from natural birth advocacy to mainstream medical guidance."

### Vaccine Books Section
The inclusion of vaccine-questioning literature aligns with the guide's philosophy of presenting all perspectives and respecting reader autonomy. The descriptions are appropriately neutral and descriptive rather than advocating for or against vaccination.

### Amazon Affiliate Disclosure
Line 7 includes appropriate transparency disclosure for resource guide monetization.

### Meta-Guidance
The chapter's "Note on Research" section (lines 252-262) provides readers with critical thinking tools to evaluate sources independently:
- Check publication dates
- Look for primary sources
- Consider funding/bias
- Trust instincts

This meta-guidance is more appropriate for a resource chapter than adding citations to individual resource descriptions.

This resources chapter requires no citation work. The two low-priority items identified are resource descriptions rather than primary claims of the guide. The chapter functions appropriately as a curated bibliography and resource directory.
