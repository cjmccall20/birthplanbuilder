**Chapter File:** `/Users/coopermccall/birthplanbuilder/content/ebook-typst/chapters/99-resources.typ`
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-08
**Auditor:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)

## Executive Summary

**Chapter Type:** Resources/Appendix
**Primary Function:** Curated bibliography and resource directory
**Total Claims Identified:** 10
**Citation Status:**
- CITED: 0
- NEEDS CITATION: 2
- NO CITATION NEEDED: 8

**Overall Assessment:** This is a resource chapter consisting primarily of book titles, descriptions, website listings, and organizational references. Most content is inherently referential (listing resources) rather than making factual claims requiring separate citations. The few factual claims identified are either common knowledge or descriptive/advisory statements appropriate for an appendix chapter.

**Key Findings:**
- Most content is resource listings (books, websites, apps, documentaries) which are self-referential
- Book descriptions are characterizations/summaries, not factual claims requiring citation
- Two claims about vaccine books make assertions that could benefit from verification
- No statistics, medical claims, or policy references requiring citation

## Detailed Claim Analysis

### SECTION 1: Introduction (Lines 3-5)

**Claim Type:** Philosophical statement / Editorial position
**No claims requiring citation identified.**

---

### SECTION 2: Essential Books (Lines 11-63)

#### Natural Birth & Advocacy (Lines 13-35)

**Claim 1** (Line 16)
> "Ina May's Guide to Childbirth" described as "The foundational text of the modern natural birth movement"

**Category:** NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Editorial characterization / common knowledge in birth literature
**Confidence:** High
**Notes:** This is a widely-accepted description of Ina May Gaskin's influence and the book's historical role. It's an editorial judgment about cultural impact, not a factual claim requiring verification.

---

**Claim 2** (Line 34)
> Sarah Buckley described as "MD" (physician)

**Category:** NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Verifiable author credential (factual but self-evident from book listing)
**Confidence:** High
**Notes:** Author credentials are standard bibliographic information.

---

#### Vaccine & Intervention Deep Dives (Lines 53-63)

**Claim 3** (Lines 55-56)
> "Turtles All the Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth" - "Examines vaccine safety testing methodology and the standards used for approval. A thorough review of the scientific literature with extensive citations."

**Category:** NEEDS CITATION (Weak)
**Reason:** Characterization of book content makes implicit claim about thoroughness and citation quality
**Proposed Source:** The book itself (review of its methodology and citation count)
**Confidence Level:** Medium
**Research Notes:** This characterization describes the book's approach and could be verified by:
- Actual citation count in the book
- Independent reviews of its methodology
- Publishers'/authors' descriptions
**Suggested Citation Approach:** Either verify the claim against the book's actual contents or soften language to "claims to examine" or "presents itself as examining"
**Priority:** Low - this is a resource description, not a primary claim of the guide

---

**Claim 4** (Lines 61-62)
> "Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies" - "Compiles and summarizes 400 peer-reviewed studies examining vaccine safety and efficacy."

**Category:** NEEDS CITATION (Weak)
**Reason:** Specific number claim (400 studies) that should be verifiable
**Proposed Source:** The book itself (table of contents, introduction, or publisher description)
**Confidence Level:** High
**Research Notes:** The "400 studies" claim is specific and factual. Should be verified against:
- The book's own description of its contents
- Publisher information
- Neil Z. Miller's documentation of the compilation
**Suggested Citation Approach:** Verify the exact number from the book or its official description
**Priority:** Low - this is describing a resource's scope, not making a medical claim

**Category:** NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Descriptive characterization of website content (observable)
**Confidence:** High
**Notes:** This describes what the website offers, which is self-evident to anyone visiting it. Not a factual claim requiring external verification.

---

**Category:** NO CITATION NEEDED
**Reason:** Editorial characterization of cultural impact
**Confidence:** High
**Notes:** This is a commonly accepted characterization of the film's cultural influence on natural birth advocacy in the US (circa 2008-2010s). It's an editorial judgment about impact, not a factual claim requiring citation.

## Summary by Category

### NO CITATION NEEDED (8 claims)
1. Ina May's book as "foundational text" (editorial characterization)
2. Sarah Buckley's MD credential (author credential)
3. Evidence Based Birth description (observable website content)
4. Cochrane Library description (observable database structure)
5. ACOG acronym expansion (common knowledge)
6. Business of Being Born cultural impact (editorial characterization)
7. Professional organization listings (directory information)
8. Research literacy principles (general advisory guidance)

### NEEDS CITATION (2 claims)
1. "Turtles All the Way Down" described as "thorough review with extensive citations" - should verify against book's actual contents or soften language
2. "Miller's Review" claiming "400 peer-reviewed studies" - specific number should be verified against book's documentation

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
**None.** This is a resource chapter, not a claims-making chapter.

### Medium Priority
**None.**

### Low Priority
1. **Verify specific book claims (2 items):**
   - Confirm "400 studies" claim for Miller's Review against publisher/author documentation
   - Verify characterization of "Turtles All the Way Down" or soften to "presents" rather than asserting thoroughness

### Editorial Notes
- This chapter functions appropriately as a resource appendix
- Book descriptions are characterizations/recommendations, not factual claims
- The two vaccine-related book descriptions make slightly stronger claims that could be verified, but priority is low since they're describing source material rather than making primary claims
- Consider adding a disclaimer that book descriptions reflect publisher/author claims and readers should evaluate sources independently (though the "Note on Research" section already serves this function)

---

## Citation Quality Assessment

**N/A** - This chapter contains no existing citations. It is a resource directory, not a claims-making chapter.

---

## Suggested Additions

**None required.** The chapter's "Note on Research" section (lines 252-262) already provides appropriate guidance for readers to evaluate sources critically:
- Check publication dates
- Look for primary sources
- Consider funding/bias
- Trust instincts

This meta-guidance is more appropriate for a resource chapter than adding citations to individual resource descriptions.

---

## Special Considerations

### Vaccine Books Section
The inclusion of vaccine-questioning literature ("Turtles All the Way Down," "The Vaccine Book," "Miller's Review") aligns with the guide's philosophy of presenting all perspectives and respecting reader autonomy. The descriptions are appropriately neutral and descriptive rather than advocating for or against vaccination.

### Resource Balance
The chapter appropriately balances natural birth advocacy resources with mainstream medical resources, consistent with the guide's stated philosophy: "resources representing multiple perspectives—from natural birth advocacy to mainstream medical guidance."

### Amazon Affiliate Disclosure
Line 7 includes appropriate disclosure: "We may earn a small commission from Amazon links, which helps support this guide at no cost to you." This is proper transparency for a resource guide.

---

## Conclusion

**Chapter Status:** COMPLIANT

This resources chapter requires minimal citation work. The two low-priority verifications identified are for resource descriptions rather than primary claims of the guide. The chapter functions appropriately as a curated bibliography and resource directory, with editorial characterizations that are standard for this type of content.

The chapter's "Note on Research" section provides readers with critical thinking tools to evaluate sources independently, which is more valuable than attempting to cite every resource description.

**Recommended Action:** Approve as-is, with optional verification of the two specific book claims if maintaining strict factual accuracy in all resource descriptions is desired.
