## NOTES FOR AUTHOR

**Strengths:**
- Clear distinction between two approaches
- Balanced presentation of benefits for both methods
- Excellent practical detail on Bradley Method technique
- Good integration of epidural context
- Respects reader autonomy throughout

**Areas for strengthening:**
- Add systematic review citation for comparative outcomes (Priority 1)
- Cite ACOG and midwifery organization positions (Priority 2)
- Support fetal oxygenation claims with research (Priority 1)
- Add epidural-specific guidance citation (Priority 3)

**Alternative approach:** If reducing citation count is preferred, could use a single comprehensive Cochrane review for most outcomes (Claims 5-9, 28) plus ACOG/ACNM for professional positions.

**Verification needed:** Confirm current ACOG position on pushing methods (Committee Opinion/Practice Bulletin number and date).

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Overall Chapter Evidence Quality:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Core claims are well-established in literature
- Multiple systematic reviews support main points
- Professional organization positions are documentable
- Bradley Method specifics may have less formal research but technique is well-described in primary source

**Citation Implementation Difficulty:** MEDIUM
- Major research claims have good systematic review support
- Professional guidelines are publicly available
- Some granular claims (hemorrhoids, tearing) may need synthesis from multiple sources
- Bradley outcomes may rely on primary source text rather than peer-reviewed outcomes studies

**Recommended minimum citations:** 6-7 (covering systematic review, pelvic floor, oxygenation, epidural, ACOG, midwifery orgs, practice patterns)

**Recommended comprehensive citations:** 8-10 (adds Bradley source, specific injury outcomes, historical practice evolution)
