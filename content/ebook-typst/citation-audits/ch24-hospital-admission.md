## Proposed New Citations

### Medical Standards & Infection Risk

- [ ] **"Every cervical check introduces a small risk of infection, and this risk goes up significantly if your water has already broken."** (line 124)
  → Cahill AG, et al. Effect of immediate vs delayed pushing on rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery among nulliparous women receiving neuraxial analgesia. _JAMA_. 2018;320(14):1444-1454. (Note: This citation addresses labor management but infection risk from cervical exams post-rupture is well-established clinical knowledge. Better source: ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 188: Prelabor Rupture of Membranes, which discusses infection risk with repeated cervical exams after membrane rupture.)
  Confidence: HIGH | Notes: Well-established obstetric principle that cervical exams after membrane rupture increase infection risk. ACOG guidelines explicitly discuss limiting vaginal exams after rupture of membranes.

### Monitoring Safety

- [ ] **"Intermittent monitoring lets you move more freely, use the shower or tub, and change positions easily. Research shows it's safe for low-risk labors."** (line 150)
  → Alfirevic Z, Devane D, Gyte GM, Cuthbert A. Continuous cardiotocography (CTG) as a form of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) for fetal assessment during labour. _Cochrane Database Syst Rev_. 2017;2:CD006066.
  Confidence: HIGH | Notes: Landmark Cochrane review establishing that intermittent auscultation is as safe as continuous monitoring for low-risk pregnancies with no increase in perinatal mortality or adverse outcomes.

### Labor Timing Guidance

- [ ] **"You may have heard of the '4-1-1 rule' — contractions 4 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour. This book advocates the 3-1-1 rule instead: contractions 3 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour."** (line 291)
  → Note: This is a clinical guideline/rule of thumb commonly taught by childbirth educators and labor nurses. The "4-1-1 rule" is traditional guidance but not derived from a single research study. The "3-1-1 rule" is advocated by some educators to reduce early hospital arrival. No specific citation exists for either rule as they are clinical practice guidelines rather than research findings.
  Confidence: LOW | Notes: These are clinical rules of thumb, not evidence-based findings from specific studies. The author is explicitly choosing to recommend 3-1-1 over 4-1-1 as a judgment call. Consider adding language: "You may have heard of the '4-1-1 rule' — a common guideline suggesting contractions 4 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour. This book advocates the 3-1-1 rule instead (contractions 3 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for 1 hour) to help reduce the chance of arriving too early and being sent home." This frames it as guidance rather than research-based recommendation.

## No Citation Needed

### Definitional/Procedural Descriptions

- "Triage is the 'assessment area' where staff determines whether you're in active labor and need to be admitted." (line 23) — Definition of standard hospital procedure

- "When you walk into Labor and Delivery... your first stop is usually triage." (line 23) — Standard hospital process description

- "Here's what typically happens: Check-in at the desk... Move to a triage room... Put on a hospital gown... Get connected to monitors... Answer questions." (lines 27-37) — Procedural description of typical triage process

- "They'll place two elastic belts around your belly—one monitors your baby's heart rate, the other tracks your contractions." (lines 35-36) — Description of standard fetal monitoring equipment and placement

- "Cervical checks are uncomfortable at best and genuinely painful for many women, especially during active contractions." (line 45) — Subjective/experiential common knowledge

- "This evaluation usually takes 20-60 minutes." (line 50) — Reasonable time estimate for typical triage evaluation (institutional variability, not research claim)

### Common Clinical Thresholds

- "You might be sent home if: You're less than 4-6 centimeters dilated (depending on the hospital)" (line 56) — Common hospital policy (varies by institution, not a research-based standard)

- "Your water has broken (even without contractions)" (line 64) — Standard admission criterion based on risk of infection and need for monitoring

- "You're in active labor (usually 5-6+ cm dilated with regular contractions)" (line 65) — Standard definition of active labor threshold for admission (Friedman's curve establishes active labor beginning around 6cm, but 4-6cm is common admission threshold)

### Advisory/Guidance

- "Pre-register around 36 weeks! Most hospitals let you complete forms ahead of time, either online or in person. This dramatically reduces the paperwork you'll deal with while having contractions." (line 85) — Practical advisory, not a factual medical claim

## Summary Notes

**Strengths:** This chapter is primarily procedural and advisory, describing what typically happens during hospital admission rather than making medical claims requiring citations. The few medical claims that are present are either well-established clinical knowledge or practical guidelines.

**Recommended additions:**
1. Add citation for infection risk with cervical exams post-rupture (ACOG guideline)
2. Add citation for intermittent vs continuous monitoring safety (Cochrane review)
3. Consider softening language around 3-1-1 vs 4-1-1 rule to acknowledge this is guidance/educator preference rather than research-based recommendation

**Overall assessment:** Chapter appropriately focuses on patient experience and practical information. The three citations proposed will strengthen the few medical claims made while maintaining the chapter's advisory and empowering tone.
