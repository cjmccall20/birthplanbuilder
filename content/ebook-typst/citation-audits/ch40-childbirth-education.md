# Citation Audit: Chapter 40 - Childbirth Education Methods

**Chapter:** 40-childbirth-education.typ
**Audit Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Active citations present; needs additional sourcing

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Chapter 40 contains 20 citations covering major childbirth education methods (Bradley, Hypnobirthing, Hypnobabies, Lamaze, etc.). The chapter has strong foundational citations but makes numerous factual claims that need support. Key gaps include:

- Statistical claims about outcomes without citation (cesarean rates, intervention rates, satisfaction scores)
- Specific method details (class lengths, homework requirements, pricing) that need verification
- Physiological claims about fear-tension-pain cycle
- Insurance coverage statements
- Historical claims about method evolution
- Cost comparisons between interventions

**Phase 0 Fix Noted:** Line 577 - Hodnett→Bohren 2017 fix already applied.

---

## FIXED IN PHASE 0

**Line 577:** Citation [1] correctly references:
- Bohren MA, et al. Continuous support for women during childbirth. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2017.

This was reportedly changed from Hodnett (older version of same Cochrane review).

## CLAIMS CORRECTLY CITED

1. **Line 9:** Education outcomes [1] - BUT WRONG CITATION (continuous support, not education)
2. **Line 11:** Method philosophies [4,5,6,8,9] - Good
3. **Line 115:** Bradley 86% rate [18] with caveat - Good
4. **Line 115-116:** 17% unmedicated in general population [2] - Good
5. **Line 152-163:** HypnoBirthing vs Hypnobabies [6,8] - Good
6. **Line 327:** Birthing From Within [15] - Adequate
7. **Citations list (lines 575-617):** 20 total citations - Comprehensive foundation

---

## CLAIMS NEEDING NO CITATION

1. Philosophical descriptions (birth as natural process, fear creates pain - when presented as method philosophy, not fact)
2. Editorial guidance ("Best For" recommendations)
3. General educational principles
4. Questions to ask yourself/instructors
5. Credential abbreviations (CCE, RN, CNM)
6. Comparison of online vs. in-person advantages
7. Budget priority statements

---

## CITATION QUALITY ISSUES

### Issue 1: Wrong Citation Used
**Line 9:** Claims about childbirth education effectiveness cite [1] Bohren 2017, which is about continuous labor support (doulas/companions), NOT childbirth education classes. These are different interventions.

**Fix:** Replace with appropriate childbirth education research (Gagnon & Sandall Cochrane review or similar).

### Issue 2: Citation Mismatch
**Line 201:** Text says "2012 study in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth" but citation [14] is "Cyna AM, et al. 2004 Cochrane Database."

**Fix:** Either find the correct 2012 BMC study or revise text to match the Cyna 2004 citation.

### Issue 3: Self-Reported Data
**Line 115:** Bradley 86% statistic appropriately caveated as self-reported, non-independent data. This is good practice and should be maintained.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Critical Corrections
1. Fix citation [1] - replace Bohren (continuous support) with childbirth education research
2. Resolve line 201 citation mismatch (2012 BMC vs. 2004 Cochrane)
3. Add fear-tension-pain cycle citation (line 51)
4. Add birth trauma/informed consent citation (line 57)
5. Verify 2026 cost data (line 488)

### Phase 2: Major Gaps
6. Add Lamaze Six Healthy Birth Practices citation (lines 240-247)
7. Add Lamaze outcomes research (lines 285-289)
8. Add fetal positioning citation (line 339)
9. Add meditation/pain research (line 355)
10. Add systematic evidence for childbirth education outcomes (lines 512-517)

### Phase 3: Supporting Details
11. Verify method-specific details from official sources (course lengths, costs, requirements)
12. Add historical citations (Lamaze origin, Hypnobabies founding)
13. Add long-term outcomes research (breastfeeding, PPD)
14. Add insurance coverage data
15. Add optimal timing guidelines

### Phase 4: Enhancement
16. Add partner experience research
17. Add qualitative satisfaction research
18. Consider adding citation for miscarriage statistics
19. Review all web citations for link rot
20. Ensure all cost ranges reflect 2026 data
