## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Overall Citation Quality:** ✅ EXCELLENT

This chapter now has:
- Comprehensive verified citations for all major claims
- Fixed citation mismatches
- Added peer-reviewed sources for safety concerns
- Verified statistical claims against source papers
- Updated with most recent research (2024-2025 acupuncture studies)
- Strong evidence base from Cochrane reviews, ACOG guidelines, and primary research

**Remaining Minor Gaps:**
1. Meconium passage statistics (Trimmer & Gilstrap 1993) - widely cited but not individually verified through academic search
2. Placental aging - alternative sources found; recommend using 2016 consensus statement
3. Inline citation needed for stillbirth table (citation exists, just needs placement)

**Recommendation:** This chapter is citation-ready for publication with the fixes applied. All high-priority claims are now verified with peer-reviewed sources.
