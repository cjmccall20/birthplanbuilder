## Summary Statistics

- **Total Factual Claims Identified:** 47
- **Has Matching Key Source:** 25
- **Needs New Citation:** 10
- **No Citation Needed:** 12

## Recommended Actions

1. **Add inline citations** for all 25 claims that match existing Key Sources using citation markers like `#cite("source-key")`

2. **Add new sources** to Key Sources list:
   - International immunization schedules (WHO or individual countries)
   - AAP funding disclosure documentation
   - FDA hepatitis B vaccine clinical trial documents/package inserts
   - Aluminum pharmacokinetics/toxicology literature
   - State vaccine exemption law database
   - Additional aluminum safety literature (if not covered by existing Tomljenovic & Shaw citation)

3. **Verify and expand** the following existing sources:
   - Ensure CDC 2025 policy source includes the ACIP meeting context (Dr. Meissner quote, international comparison)
   - Ensure VAERS sources can support both the description AND the specific HBV report statistics
   - Ensure WHO source covers the full range of statistics cited (chronic infection rates, mortality, cancer, prevalence)

4. **Consider adding FDA-specific sources** for:
   - Aluminum limits in injectable products
   - Clinical trial methodology/approval documents
   - Package inserts for specific hepatitis B vaccines

5. **Mark sensitivity:** The AAP funding claim (line 98) is particularly sensitive and MUST be carefully sourced to maintain credibility.

## Notes on Chapter Approach

This chapter takes a notably balanced, multi-perspective approach that respects all decision paths (vaccinate/delay/decline). The extensive "no citation needed" category reflects:

1. **Clear editorial voice** in "Our Take" and guidance sections
2. **Logical reasoning** applied to test results and transmission routes
3. **Ethical/value frameworks** (precautionary principle, informed decision-making)
4. **Hypothetical scenarios** and decision-making guidance

This is appropriate for the chapter's stated purpose: to help parents make informed decisions. The factual claims that DO require citations are properly identified and should be cited to maintain the chapter's credibility and trust with readers who are carefully evaluating the evidence.

The chapter's strength is its transparent acknowledgment of uncertainty and debate (trial design, aluminum safety, VAERS interpretation) while still providing clear facts where they exist. Proper citation will reinforce this approach.
