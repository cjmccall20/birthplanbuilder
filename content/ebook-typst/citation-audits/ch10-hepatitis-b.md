### 7. **Liver Cancer as Second Most Common Cause (Line 42)**
**Claim:** "Hepatitis B is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide after tobacco"

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED / 📊 STAT NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Notes:** This claim is imprecise. Hepatitis B is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), which is one of the most common cancers worldwide. However, the phrasing "second most common cause of cancer worldwide after tobacco" is not directly supported in the literature searched. The WHO fact sheet discusses HBV's role in liver cancer specifically, not as the second leading cause of all cancers.

**Recommendation:** Rephrase to: "Hepatitis B is a leading cause of liver cancer worldwide, which is among the most common cancers globally" or cite the specific statistic about HBV-related liver cancer.

**Citation:** `#cite("who-hbv-factsheet")` (with revised wording)

### 9. **Vaccine + HBIG Protocol Effectiveness (Lines 54, 220)**
**Claim:** "These babies should receive the hepatitis B vaccine AND hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth" / "effectiveness is 94%"

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Source:** CDC
- "Treatment initiated within 12 hours after birth is up to 94% effective at preventing this serious infection"
- Vaccine + HBIG protocol well-documented

**Citation:** `#cite("cdc-perinatal-hbv")`

### 10. **Prenatal Screening Gaps (Lines 80-82)**
**Claim:** "10-16% of pregnant people are not tested" / "60% of commercially insured and 39% of Medicaid-enrolled women tested in first trimester"

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED / 📊 STAT DISCREPANCY ON TRIMESTER TIMING

**Source:** CDC research, peer-reviewed study
- "Approximately 15% between 2015 and 2019" not tested (within 10-16% range)

- Earlier data: 12.3%-18% commercially insured, 16.4% Medicaid (2011-2014)

**Trimester timing claim:** The "60% of commercially insured and 39% of Medicaid-enrolled" appears to refer to first trimester testing rates, but this needs verification of whether these are the exact figures cited in the source.

**Citation:** `#cite("uspstf-hbv-screening")` or new citation for specific study

**Proposed Source:** CDC vaccine information or immunology literature

**Confidence:** HIGH (standard immunology)

**Suggested Citation Key:** `#cite("cdc-hbv-immunogenicity")` or vaccine efficacy literature

## SUMMARY STATISTICS

### Verification Status:
- **✅ VERIFIED:** 23 citations
- **✅ PARTIALLY VERIFIED / 📊 STAT DISCREPANCY:** 5 citations
- **⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED:** 3 citations
- **⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION/CITATION:** 7 proposed new citations

### Key Statistical Discrepancies Found:

1. **📊 Line 42 - Liver cancer claim:** Imprecise phrasing needs revision
2. **📊 Lines 80-82 - Trimester testing rates:** Specific percentages need source verification
3. **📊 Line 88 - Awareness rate:** 50% vs. 68% discrepancy depending on time period
4. **📊 Lines 217-218 - Low viral load transmission:** Should be 10-40%, not 5-20%
5. **📊 Lines 246-248 - Injection site soreness:** 8-20% figure not directly confirmed in search

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority Actions:

1. **Revise stat discrepancies** identified above (especially maternal viral load transmission rates)

2. **Add missing citations** for clinical trial methodology, aluminum pharmacokinetics, and cumulative exposure concerns

3. **Verify AAP funding claim sources** - while factually verified, sources are from advocacy organizations; consider adding mainstream journalism sources if available

4. **Clarify liver cancer claim** (Line 42) to be more precise about HBV's role in hepatocellular carcinoma specifically

5. **Add specific FDA package insert citations** for aluminum content and clinical trial design

6. **Update awareness statistic** (Line 88) with timeframe or use more recent estimate

### Medium Priority Actions:

1. Obtain primary source for New York State rejection claim
2. Verify ACIP Dr. Meissner quote from meeting transcripts
3. Add direct NHS source for UK vaccination schedule
4. Query VAERS database for specific HBV report numbers
5. Add NCSL or CDC source for state exemption laws

### Citation Quality Notes:

**Strongest sources:** CDC, WHO, USPSTF (institutional, authoritative, directly verifiable)

**Good sources:** Peer-reviewed academic papers (DOIs provided), FDA package inserts

**Requires context:** AAP funding claim (verified but from advocacy sources)

**Needs improvement:** Claims without specific citations (trial methodology, aluminum pharmacokinetics)

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Overall Chapter Citation Quality:** GOOD with areas for improvement

**Strengths:**
- Major factual claims have strong institutional backing (CDC, WHO, USPSTF)
- Statistics are generally accurate with minor discrepancies
- Key 2025 policy change well-documented
- Safety data verifiable through multiple sources

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Several statistical discrepancies need correction
- Some claims lack specific citations (trial methodology, aluminum pharmacokinetics)
- Some proposed citations need academic backing
- A few claims would benefit from additional primary sources

**Confidence in Verification:** HIGH for most claims, MEDIUM for a subset requiring additional sources

---

**Audit completed by:** Academic search tools (Semantic Scholar, Crossref) and web searches (CDC, WHO, FDA, USPSTF, AAP, peer-reviewed sources)

**Date:** 2026-02-08

**Next Steps:** Address stat discrepancies, add missing citations, and integrate inline citation markers into chapter text.
