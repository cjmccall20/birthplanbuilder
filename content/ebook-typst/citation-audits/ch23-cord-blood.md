## Proposed New Citations

### Section: What Is Cord Blood

- [ ] **"cord blood stem cells are FDA-approved to treat about 80 conditions, including blood cancers, blood disorders, immune system disorders, and inherited metabolic disorders"** (line 19-24)
  → U.S. Food and Drug Administration. _Cord Blood Banking: Information for Consumers_. FDA.gov. Updated 2024.
  Confidence: HIGH | Notes: FDA maintains a list of approved cord blood uses; the "about 80" figure is widely cited but exact number should be verified with current FDA guidance

- [ ] **"ongoing research into using cord blood for conditions like cerebral palsy, autism, and type 1 diabetes—but these are experimental, not proven treatments"** (line 26)
  → Sun JM, et al. _Cord blood for brain injury_. _Cytotherapy_. 2017;19(2):149-159.
  Confidence: MEDIUM | Notes: Multiple clinical trials exist (Duke's cerebral palsy trials, etc.); may want to add NIH clinical trials database as source

### Section: The Real Statistics

- [ ] **"The chance of a child using their own stored cord blood is somewhere between 1 in 2,700 and 1 in 200,000"** (line 45)
  → Nietfeld JJ, et al. _Lifetime probability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the US_. _Biol Blood Marrow Transplant_. 2008;14(3):316-322.

  → National Weather Service. _Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States_. NOAA. 2023.
  Confidence: HIGH | Notes: Standard NOAA statistic for lifetime lightning strike risk

  → Company pricing data from major banks (CBR, ViaCord, Cryo-Cell). Accessed 2026.
  Confidence: MEDIUM | Notes: **FORMATTING ERROR** - this shows same number twice; should be verified range like "$1,400 to $2,500" or similar

- [ ] **"Annual storage fees: $100 to $100 per year"** (line 84)
  → Company pricing data from major banks. Accessed 2026.

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Cost Figure Errors (Multiple Instances)

**Lines 82, 84, 267:**
- Current: "$1,500 to $1,500" and "$100 to $100"
- Issue: Same-number ranges (formatting error)
- Action needed: Research actual 2026 price ranges from major cord blood banks

**Line 86, 268:**
- Current: "$1,300 to $1,900 total" and "$1,300-$1,000+"
- Issue: Numbers don't match the upfront + annual calculation; second instance is reversed
- Action needed: Recalculate based on corrected ranges (e.g., if upfront is $1,400-$2,500 and annual is $125-$200, then 18 years = $3,650-$6,100)

### 2. Table Formatting Issue (Line 211)

**Line 211:**
- Current: "[\$1,000-\$1,000+]"
- Issue: Same-number range in comparison table
- Action needed: Use corrected lifetime cost range

### 3. Verification Priorities

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. Verify all cost figures against 2026 pricing from CBR, ViaCord, Cryo-Cell
2. Confirm current FDA-approved condition count (is it still ~80 in 2026?)
3. Verify AAP 2017 policy is still current guidance

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
1. Confirm market size estimate ($1+ billion) with 2025-2026 data
2. Verify specific companies mentioned are still operational
3. Check that BeTheMatch.org URLs are current

## Summary Statistics

- **Total claims identified:** 35
- **Need citation:** 27
- **No citation needed:** 8 (definitions, advisory content, subjective framing)

## Confidence Distribution

- **HIGH confidence:** 20 claims (well-established medical facts, organizational recommendations)
- **MEDIUM confidence:** 5 claims (industry data, pricing that needs 2026 verification)
- **LOW confidence:** 2 claims (miscalculated cost figures requiring correction)

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL:** Fix all cost calculation errors before publication
2. Verify all HIGH confidence citations with current sources
3. Update MEDIUM confidence citations with 2026 data where applicable
4. Consider adding American Pregnancy Association or Parents' Guide to Cord Blood as additional consumer-focused sources
5. For experimental treatments claim (line 26), consider adding citation to ClinicalTrials.gov search results showing active research

## Notes on Chapter Quality

This chapter does an excellent job of:
- Presenting balanced information about all options (private banking, public donation, delayed clamping)
- Using clear statistics to help readers evaluate choices
- Avoiding fear-based framing while still being honest about industry marketing tactics
- Respecting reader autonomy in decision-making

The main issues are technical (cost figure errors) rather than content-related. Once citations are added and costs corrected, this chapter will be well-supported and authoritative.
