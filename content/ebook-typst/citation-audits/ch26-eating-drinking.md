## PARTIALLY VERIFIED CITATIONS

### Citation 10: Aspiration Risk Statistic "0.7 per million"
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - 📊 STAT DISCREPANCY

**Claim (Line 20):** "The actual risk is estimated at 0.7 per million—about the same as being struck by lightning"

**Search findings:**
- UK studies found aspiration incidence of **6 per 1,000,000 maternities** (not 0.7)
- General anesthesia aspiration rate: **2 in 10,000 GAs**
- Anesthesia-related maternal mortality in US: **0.09 per 100,000 (2013-2015)**
- Lightning death rate in US: **~0.06 per million annually (2023 data)**

**Verification method:** Web search of UK Confidential Enquiry data, obstetric anesthesia surveillance studies

**Issue:** The "0.7 per million" figure could not be verified in published literature. Available data suggests:
- Overall aspiration in pregnancy: 6 per million (higher than claimed)
- Lightning deaths: 0.06 per million (lower than aspiration risk)

**Recommended revision:**
```
"The actual risk is extremely rare—UK surveillance data shows approximately 6 cases per million maternities"
```
OR remove the specific number and use:
```
"The actual risk is extremely rare, comparable to other rare surgical complications"
```

**Sources found:**
- [UK Confidential Enquiry data](https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/anae.14246)
- [MBRRACE-UK surveillance](https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/maternal-programme/maternal-confidential-enquiries)

---

### Citation 11: Regional Anesthesia Percentage
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - Needs specific statistic

**Claim (Line 17):** "Modern cesareans almost always use regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal), not general"

**Search findings:**
- Multiple sources confirm regional anesthesia is "preferred" for cesarean sections
- Specific percentage not found in 2020-2023 literature searched
- Failure rate for regional: 4.9% conversion to general anesthesia (5,000+ cesarean study)
- Historical data shows dramatic shift toward regional over past 40 years

**Verification method:** Web search of recent cesarean anesthesia statistics

**Recommendation:** The claim "almost always" is qualitatively accurate based on clinical literature, though specific percentage (90-95%) cited in the audit could not be verified. Consider either:
1. Keep "almost always" without specific percentage (accurate as written)
2. Add reference to ACOG Practice Bulletin 209 (2019) which discusses regional preference
3. Use specific study data: "over 95% of cesareans are completed with regional anesthesia" if source can be located

**Suggested citation:** ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 209 (already verified above) discusses this extensively.

## ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOUND

### UK NICE Guidelines
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (Authoritative Source)

**Claim (Line 31):** "The UK and many European countries have allowed eating during labor for years"

**Verified Source:**
- **Organization:** National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
- **Title:** "Intrapartum care for healthy women and babies"
- **Guideline:** Clinical Guideline CG190
- **Published:** December 2014
- **Updated:** February 2017
- **URL:** https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190

**Notes:** NICE CG190 explicitly supports eating and drinking during labor for healthy women. This is the official UK guideline supporting the chapter's claim about international practices.

---

### Energy Expenditure Research
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (Supporting Evidence)

**Claim (Lines 5, 24, 53):** "Marathon-level physical effort...Labor is physically demanding, comparable to a marathon"

**Search findings:**
- Marathon burns ~2,600 calories; childbirth burns 500-3,000 calories depending on duration
- Pregnant women operate at 2.2x resting metabolic rate (near maximum sustainable energy expenditure)
- Duke University study compared pregnancy to 120-day ultra-endurance race

**Verification method:** Web search of labor energy expenditure research

**Notes:** The marathon comparison is scientifically supported by energy expenditure data. Multiple sources confirm labor's caloric demands are comparable to marathon running.

**Sources:**
- [BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth study on energy management](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-025-07172-4)
- [PubMed: Energy expenditure in normal labor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2116380/)

---

### Ketosis During Labor Research
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED (Supporting Evidence)

**Claim (Lines 25, 53):** "Fasting leads to ketosis...which can cause nausea and fatigue"

**Search findings:**
- Ketosis in labor is common due to increased physical stress + reduced oral intake
- Pregnant women develop starvation ketosis faster than non-pregnant individuals
- Correlation found between nausea in pregnancy and fasting diet patterns

**Verification method:** Web search of ketosis/labor/fasting research

**Sources:**
- [Cochrane: Interventions for ketosis during labour](https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD004230_interventions-ketosis-during-labour)
- [PMC: Effect of Elevated Ketone Body on Maternal Outcomes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7701151/)

## CLAIMS NOT REQUIRING CITATION

The following claims are either common knowledge, practical observations, or appropriately qualified subjective statements that do not require formal academic citations:

1. **Line 27:** "Dehydration requires IV fluids, which limits mobility" — Clinical standard practice
2. **Line 43:** "Nausea is common during labor, especially in transition" — Well-established clinical observation
3. **Lines 59-60:** Food recommendations (honey sticks, energy bars, etc.) — Practical advice, not medical claims
4. **Line 61:** "It would be very difficult for a hospital to physically prevent you from eating" — Practical/legal observation about patient autonomy

---

## RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE REVISIONS

### Revision 1: Aspiration Risk Statistic
**Current (Line 20):** "The actual risk is estimated at 0.7 per million—about the same as being struck by lightning"

**Recommended:**
```
"The actual risk is extremely rare—UK surveillance data shows approximately 6 cases per million maternities, and modern anesthesia techniques have reduced this risk dramatically"
```

**Rationale:** The 0.7 per million figure could not be verified. UK data shows 6 per million, and lightning comparison is not quite accurate (lightning deaths are actually lower at 0.06 per million).

---

### Revision 2: "Essentially Zero" Language
**Current (Line 55):** "fasting reduces that risk to essentially zero"

**Recommended:**
```
"fasting significantly reduces that risk"
```
OR
```
"fasting minimizes that risk"
```

**Rationale:** "Essentially zero" overstates the case—even fasted patients have gastric secretions and reflux risk. The language should be accurate without being alarmist.
