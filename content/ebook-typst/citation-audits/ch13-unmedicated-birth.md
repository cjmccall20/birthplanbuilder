## SUMMARY

This chapter has **15 inline citations** supporting key claims about unmedicated birth benefits, doula support, childbirth education methods, intervention rates, and coping techniques. The == CITATIONS section provides adequate sources including Cochrane reviews, ACOG guidelines, hormonal physiology research, and method-specific references.

**Citation coverage:** GOOD overall. Most major claims are cited.

**Gaps identified:** Several factual claims lack citations, particularly statistics about hospital practices (epidural rates, monitoring rates, intervention rates) and specific physiological details.

## FIXED IN PHASE 0

### 1. Bradley Method Success Rate (Lines 9, 96)
**Original claim:** "86% of trained couples achieve unmedicated delivery"
**Phase 0 fix:** Softened to "the majority of trained couples achieve unmedicated delivery" with disclaimer that "independent verification of this figure is not available"
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Appropriately hedged given lack of independent verification

### 2. Sarah Buckley Citation (Line 440)
**Original:** Citation [6] pointed to sarahbuckley.com
**Phase 0 fix:** Replaced with proper publication: "Buckley SJ. Hormonal Physiology of Childbearing: Evidence and Implications for Women, Babies, and Maternity Care. National Partnership for Women & Families / Childbirth Connection. 2015."
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — Now properly cited to reputable publication

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**Citation Coverage: B+**

The chapter has solid citation coverage for major evidence-based claims (doula support, continuous labor support, coping techniques, hormonal physiology). The Cochrane reviews and ACOG guidance provide strong foundation.

**Gaps:**
1. Hospital statistics (monitoring rates, intervention rates) lack citations
2. Some specific physiological claims need sourcing (Pitocin BBB, effacement percentages)
3. Labor duration and positioning statistics missing
4. Home birth comparison uncited

**Strengths:**
1. All major benefit claims are cited with quality sources
2. Childbirth method information appropriately sourced or attributed
3. Phase 0 fixes addressed problematic claims effectively
4. Cascade of interventions supported by ACOG guidance

**Recommended actions:**
1. Add 6-8 citations for statistical claims
2. Verify existing citation numbers match claims
3. Consider consolidating duplicate Buckley citations
4. Add inline citations to existing sources where applicable (stress/oxytocin, darkness/oxytocin)

---

## NOTES

- This chapter appropriately balances evidence-based claims with philosophical/guidance content
- The "What Hospitals Tell You" section doesn't require citations (representative statements)
- Technique descriptions are appropriately detailed without over-citing common knowledge
- The tone successfully maintains respect for reader autonomy while providing thorough information
- Phase 0 fixes were well-executed and maintain chapter integrity
