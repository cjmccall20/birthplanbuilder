# Citation Audit: Chapter 12 - Circumcision

**Chapter file:** `/Users/coopermccall/birthplanbuilder/content/ebook-typst/chapters/12-circumcision.typ`

**Audit date:** 2026-02-08

**Current state:** Chapter has Key Sources section but NO inline citation markers. Phase 0 fixes were applied to soften nerve ending claim and correct death rate study year.

---

## Summary

This chapter contains **156 factual claims** requiring citation verification:
- **14 claims** have matching Key Sources (9%)
- **2 claims** were fixed in Phase 0 (1%)
- **119 claims** need new citations (76%)
- **21 claims** need no citation (14%)

**Critical gaps:** Statistics throughout (UTI numbers, complication rates, global circumcision rates, historical timeline), medical organization positions (international statements), adult circumcision studies, pain/trauma research, and historical claims about anti-masturbation origins.

---

## Fixed in Phase 0

### 1. Nerve ending count claim (Line 32)
**Original claim:** "20,000 nerve endings"
**Fixed to:** "thousands of nerve endings concentrated in a small area of tissue"
**Rationale:** Specific 20,000 figure lacks definitive sourcing; "thousands" is more defensible

### 2. Death rate study attribution (Lines 172-175)
**Original:** Study year unclear or incorrect
**Fixed to:** "A 2010 analysis by Bollinger estimated approximately *117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths occur annually in the United States* (about 9.01 per 100,000 circumcisions)"
**Rationale:** Correctly attributes to Bollinger 2010 study

## High-Priority Citations Needed

### CRITICAL (statistical claims needing verification)
1. **Bollinger 2010 death statistics** - Phase 0 attribution complete, but full citation needed
2. **Adult circumcision sensitivity percentages** (lines 214-216) - specific study needed
3. **Canadian complications study** (line 183) - needs identification
4. **15% bleeding rate** (line 190) - needs specific source
5. **Historical circumcision rates** (lines 338-341) - specific sources needed
6. **Global/country-specific rates** (lines 365-384) - Morris et al. 2016 or WHO data

### HIGH (well-known studies likely findable)
1. **African HIV RCTs** - Auvert, Bailey, Gray studies (line 111)
2. **Taddio vaccination pain study** (line 264)
3. **Cold & Taylor 1999 anatomy** (lines 31-32, 50-51)
4. **Sorrells 2007 sensitivity mapping** (line 32, 212)
5. **Cortisol/stress hormone studies** (line 259)
6. **Historical Kellogg/Graham references** (lines 326-327)

## Notes for Phase 1 Implementation

1. **Key Sources already available:** The chapter has good foundational sources (AAP, international medical organizations, complications, UTI prevention, sensitivity studies, care guides). These should be linked inline where appropriate.

2. **Citation clusters:** Many claims come from the same studies (e.g., Cold & Taylor for anatomy, African RCTs for HIV, Taddio for pain). One well-placed citation can cover multiple related claims.

3. **Historical claims:** The anti-masturbation history section (lines 316-344) makes numerous specific factual and quote claims that need verification. Gollaher 2000 and Darby 2005 are likely primary sources for this entire section.

4. **Statistical precision:** Many percentage claims need exact source verification (sensitivity percentages, complication rates, global circumcision rates). Some may need softening if precise sources unavailable.

5. **Methodological notes:** The chapter already includes good methodological caveats (e.g., noting Ramos & Boyle limitations, explaining study contradictions). This demonstrates appropriate evidence evaluation.

6. **Quote attribution:** Dr. Freedman quote (line 72), researcher quotes (line 187), and historical quotes (lines 326-335) all need specific source attribution.
