## Detailed Claim Analysis

### SECTION: "THE QUICK ANSWER"

**Claim 1:** "Most families choose to complete it, making this one of the most straightforward screenings in newborn care."

- **Status:** NO CITATION NEEDED (Common knowledge / observational)
- **Reason:** Descriptive claim about screening acceptance; not a statistical assertion requiring citation

**Claim 10:** "A follow-up test is scheduled (usually within a few weeks)"

- **Status:** NO CITATION NEEDED (Standard clinical protocol)
- **Reason:** Describes standard follow-up procedure; procedural information
- **Notes:** Timeline may vary by facility but general guidance is accurate

**Claim 11:** "If confirmed, intervention begins: hearing aids, cochlear implants, sign language, speech therapy"

- **Status:** NO CITATION NEEDED (Standard treatment options)
- **Reason:** Lists standard intervention modalities; not a research claim
- **Notes:** Accurately describes available interventions

**Claim 12:** "Early intervention programs are available in all states"

- **Notes:** Consistent with earlier description

**Claim 17:** "Catches a condition where early detection dramatically improves outcomes"

- **Status:** NEEDS CITATION (cross-reference)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Proposed source:** Same citation as Claim 6 (6-month intervention outcomes)
- **Rationale:** Summary statement supported by earlier evidence claim
- **Suggested approach:** Should reference the same citation(s) used for Claims 4-6
- **Notes:** This synthesizes the evidence argument; citation should tie to specific evidence claims

**Claim 18:** "Babies identified with hearing loss before 6 months have significantly better language development than those caught later"

- **Status:** NEEDS CITATION (duplicate of Claim 6)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Proposed source:** Same citation as Claim 6
- **Rationale:** Restatement of the key evidence claim
- **Suggested approach:** Use same citation as Claim 6

## Suggested Language Refinements

### For LOW-confidence claims (none in this chapter):
No low-confidence claims identified. All factual assertions are well-supported by existing literature.

### For claims without specific citations available:
If specific prevalence or outcome data cannot be located, consider softening language:
- "About 1-3 babies per 1,000" → "Approximately 1-3 babies per 1,000 (with estimates varying by population)"
- "2-10% of babies need repeat testing" → "A small percentage of babies need repeat testing (typically 2-10%)"

## Overall Assessment

**Citation density:** This chapter makes appropriate use of factual claims to support its argument for hearing screening. The evidence section is well-structured with clear claims.

**Citation gaps:** Currently uncited but needs 14 citations across 18 factual claims (78% citation gap).

**Research availability:** HIGH — Newborn hearing screening is a well-researched public health intervention with abundant peer-reviewed literature and policy documentation. All claims should be citeable with authoritative sources.

**Key sources to prioritize:**
1. Yoshinaga-Itano landmark studies (or JCIH position statements citing them)
2. CDC EHDI program data for prevalence and screening outcomes
3. Review articles on early language development and critical periods

**Tone assessment:** The chapter maintains appropriate respect for parental autonomy while presenting strong evidence. The "Our Take" section acknowledges this is "about as one-sided as it gets" but still respects the family's right to decline. No tone adjustments needed.

---

## Implementation Notes

**Typst citation format:** Use `#citation[N]` where N is the reference number.

**Suggested workflow:**
1. Add Tier 1 citations first (Claims 6, 7, 14) — these are the most critical
2. Add Tier 2 citations (Claims 4, 5, 9) — these support the core argument
3. Add Tier 3 citations (Claims 8, 12, 13) — these provide helpful context
4. Create reference list at end of chapter (or in centralized references file)

**Cross-referencing:** Claims 6 and 18 should use the same citation (both refer to 6-month intervention outcomes).
