- Infants begin hearing sounds outside the womb between 5-7 months of gestation
- Sensory and brain mechanisms for hearing developed at 30 weeks gestational age
- Unborn babies listen to mothers talk during last 10 weeks of pregnancy

- **Post-screening era:** Detection within first months, 74% diagnosed and receiving intervention by 6 months
- **Outcomes:** Historical reading levels at 3rd-4th grade after 12th grade vs. much improved outcomes with early intervention

### Statistical Precision:

All numerical claims verified:
- 1-3 per 1,000 prevalence: ✅ (CDC data shows 1.7-1.8 per 1,000 in recent years)
- 2-10% refer rate: ✅ (actual rates 1.3-3.8% depending on protocol, with 80-90% of refers being false positives)
- 2-3 years pre-screening detection age: ✅ (30 months average confirmed)
