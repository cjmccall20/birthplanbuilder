## Proposed New Citations - UNABLE TO VERIFY

- [ ] ❌ **UNVERIFIED** — **"Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium, difficulty with breastfeeding due to breast engorgement"** (line 25)
  → Proposed: Chappell LC, Bell JL, Smith A, et al. A randomised, controlled trial of intravenous fluid restriction during labour. _BJOG_. 2002;109(12):1340-1347.
  **Status:** ❌ **CANNOT VERIFY** | Extensive search of Crossref, Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and BJOG archives found NO matching article by these authors in 2002 on this topic.

  🔄 **ALTERNATIVE VERIFIED CITATIONS:**
  - Hyponatremia and edema from IV overhydration in labor: Multiple sources verify this concern, including:
    - NHS Resolution guidelines on maternal hyponatremia (2023)
    - Demertzidou et al. "Peripartum hyponatraemia: an overview of physiology, prevention and management." _The Obstetrician & Gynaecologist_. 2022. doi:10.1111/tog.12809
    - NHS Wales "Guideline for the Prevention, Diagnosis and Management of Hyponatraemia in Labour"
  - Breast engorgement link to IV fluids: Supported by Chantry 2011 study (cited above) which found maternal fluid balance affects neonatal outcomes including weight loss patterns.

  **Recommendation:** Replace Chappell citation with verified alternatives focusing on hyponatremia/edema risks. Consider separating breast engorgement claim or linking to Chantry 2011 study context.

---

## No Citation Needed

- **"Healthy women can drink fluids during labor"** (line 24) — Cross-reference to chapter on Eating/Drinking; addressed there with citations.

- **"GBS+ and receiving antibiotics"** (line 32) — Clinical indication, not a claim requiring sourcing; covered in GBS chapter.

- **"Pitocin induction/augmentation"** (line 33) — Standard medical indication, definitional.

- **"Continuous fluids increase bathroom trips, which can be disruptive during labor"** (line 27) — Logical consequence of fluid intake; self-evident.

## Notes for Author Review

1. **❌ Chappell 2002 BJOG citation CANNOT BE VERIFIED**
   - Extensive academic database search found NO matching publication
   - LC Chappell is a real researcher (pre-eclampsia expert at King's College London) but no 2002 BJOG article on IV fluid restriction in labor was found
   - **ACTION REQUIRED:** Replace with verified alternatives:
     - For hyponatremia/edema: Demertzidou et al. 2022 or NHS clinical guidelines
     - For breast engorgement: Link to Chantry 2011 or remove/soften claim
     - General IV overhydration risks: Multiple sources available from NHS, American Journal of Kidney Diseases

2. **Line 26 claim precision:** The "one study found" language is good — it accurately represents this as a single study finding (Chantry 2011) rather than consensus. ✅ Consider adding the study year inline: "A 2011 study found..."

3. **📊 DEHP percentage (line 74):** The 70–75% figure is **VERIFIED** but declining as hospitals transition away from DEHP. ✅ **Recommendation:** Add temporal qualifier: "As of the early 2020s, roughly 70–75%..." or soften to "the majority of."

4. **Animal studies caveat (line 79):** ✅ Current language appropriately says "animal studies have raised concerns" — this correctly signals that human evidence is more limited. Gray 2000 study VERIFIED. No change needed.

5. **IV placement difficulty (line 54):** This is clinical consensus but hard to cite directly. **Recommendation:** Move to "No Citation Needed" with reasoning "Clinical practice observation" OR reframe as: "Clinicians generally find it easier to place..." to make it clear this is practice wisdom rather than research.

6. **Emergency access claim (line 53):** Standard of care documented in ACOG Bulletin 177 (VERIFIED). Can cite OR rephrase to "standard protocol requires IV access" to signal practice rather than evidence. Either approach valid.

7. **✅ Proposition 65 (line 78):** **VERIFIED** — DEHP is listed. Verify current listing status before publication (California updates regularly, but DEHP has been listed since 1988).

8. **✅ Cochrane mobility review (line 29):** **VERIFIED** — Lawrence et al. 2013 (pub3 update). Note specifies first stage labor benefits. Consider adding "during first stage labor" for precision if space allows.

9. **GBS antibiotic timing (line 32):**
   - ✅ "Every 4 hours" — **VERIFIED** via ACOG 797
   - ✅ "15-30 minutes per round" — **VERIFIED** via multiple pharmacy sources for ampicillin IV infusion
   - Both claims supported

10. **Manufacturer products (line 87):** ✅ **VERIFIED** — B. Braun and ICU Medical both offer DEHP-free alternatives as of 2021-2024. Confirm current product availability at time of publication.

## Suggested Language Revisions

### Line 25 (Overhydration claim) - NEEDS REPLACEMENT CITATION

**Current:** "Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium, difficulty with breastfeeding due to breast engorgement"

**Suggested revision with verified citations:**
"Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium (hyponatremia), and potentially difficulty with breastfeeding. Maternal intrapartum fluid balance has been shown to affect neonatal outcomes, including weight loss patterns in breastfed newborns."

**New citation options:**
1. For hyponatremia/edema: Demertzidou E, Broughton Pipkin F, Yentis SM. Peripartum hyponatraemia: an overview of physiology, prevention and management. _The Obstetrician & Gynaecologist_. 2022;24(4):267-277. doi:10.1111/tog.12809
2. For neonatal effects: Chantry et al. 2011 (already cited for line 26)

### Line 74 (DEHP percentage) - ADD TEMPORAL CONTEXT

**Current:** "Roughly 70–75% of IV containers used in US hospitals are made with PVC plasticized with DEHP"

**Suggested:** "As of the early 2020s, roughly 70–75% of IV containers used in US hospitals are made with PVC plasticized with DEHP, though many hospitals are actively transitioning to DEHP-free alternatives"

### Line 54 (IV placement difficulty) - REPHRASE OR MOVE TO "NO CITATION"

**Current:** "It is easier to place a catheter when you are calm and still in early labor than during active labor or an emergency..."

**Suggested:** "Clinicians generally find it easier to place a catheter when you are calm and still in early labor than during active labor or an emergency..." [No citation needed - clinical practice observation]

## Final Recommendations

1. ✅ **APPROVE** all citations marked with ✅ VERIFIED — these have confirmed DOIs or official source verification
2. ❌ **REPLACE** Chappell 2002 citation with verified alternatives (Demertzidou 2022 for hyponatremia; expand Chantry 2011 for neonatal effects)
3. ⚠️ **MODIFY** DEHP percentage claim to include temporal context ("As of the early 2020s...")
4. ⚠️ **CONSIDER** moving IV placement difficulty to "no citation needed" with clinical practice rationale
5. 📊 **VERIFY** before publication: Current Prop 65 DEHP listing status, current B. Braun/ICU Medical product availability

**Document ready for author review and implementation.**
