  Confidence: HIGH | Notes: Standard of care for emergency operative delivery; no citation needed if framed as clinical practice rather than evidence-based claim.

- [ ] **"It is easier to place a catheter when you are calm and still in early labor than during active labor or an emergency, when veins may be harder to find and holding still is difficult"** (line 54)
  → [Clinical practice observation; consider softening to "generally easier" or moving to "No Citation Needed"]
  Confidence: MEDIUM | Notes: Clinical consensus but difficult to cite specific study; consider rephrasing as clinical experience rather than factual claim.

## No Citation Needed

- **"Healthy women can drink fluids during labor"** (line 24) — Cross-reference to chapter on Eating/Drinking; addressed there with citations.

- **"GBS+ and receiving antibiotics"** (line 32) — Clinical indication, not a claim requiring sourcing; covered in GBS chapter.

- **"Pitocin induction/augmentation"** (line 33) — Standard medical indication, definitional.

- **"Continuous fluids increase bathroom trips, which can be disruptive during labor"** (line 27) — Logical consequence of fluid intake; self-evident.

## Notes for Author Review

1. **Line 26 claim precision:** The "one study found" language is good — it accurately represents this as a single study finding rather than consensus. Consider adding the study year (2011) inline: "A 2011 study found..."

2. **DEHP percentage (line 74):** The 70–75% figure may be dated as hospitals transition away from DEHP. Consider adding a date qualifier: "As of the early 2020s, roughly 70–75%..." or soften to "many" or "the majority of."

3. **Animal studies caveat (line 79):** Current language appropriately says "animal studies have raised concerns" — this correctly signals that human evidence is more limited. No change needed unless you want to add "though human studies are more limited" for transparency.

4. **IV placement difficulty (line 54):** This is clinical consensus but hard to cite directly. Consider moving to "No Citation Needed" with reasoning "Clinical practice observation" OR reframe as: "Clinicians generally find it easier to place..."

5. **Emergency access claim (line 53):** This is standard of care, but framing it as "anesthesia requires IV access" makes it sound like evidence. Either cite ACOG guidelines OR rephrase to "standard protocol requires IV access" to make it clear this is practice rather than physiology.

6. **Proposition 65 (line 78):** Verify current listing status before publication. California updates this list regularly.

7. **Missing nuance on mobility:** The mobility claim (line 29) is well-supported but mostly for first stage labor. Consider adding "during first stage labor" for precision if the Cochrane review specifies this.

## Suggested Language Softeners (if citations unavailable)

- Line 74: "Roughly 70–75%" → "Many" or "The majority of"
- Line 54: "easier to place" → "generally easier to place" or "often easier to place"
- Line 32: "typically runs for 15–30 minutes" → "usually runs for about 15–30 minutes"
