- **Cost sources:** Create mapping of which source covers which cost category
- **Epidural rate 70-75%:** This may be outdated (2008 source); check for 2023-2024 CDC data

---

## Notes on Citation Philosophy

This chapter does a good job citing the major research studies (OSU 2024, UK Birthplace, NBCS II, Lancet meta-analysis) and cost data sources. However:

1. **Many standalone statistics lack citations** (e.g., "98% hospital births," "32% cesarean," "70-75% epidural")
2. **Hospital variation claims** need state-level or Leapfrog data citations
3. **Historical trend data** (induction rates, episiotomy rates over time) needs CDC longitudinal data
4. **Intervention rate comparisons** should explicitly cite which study provides which comparison
5. **Transfer rate breakdowns** should clarify if they're from one study or synthesized from multiple

**Recommendation:** Add 15-20 inline citations or footnotes for the high-priority items, then add a note in the Citations section mapping which sources cover which claims.
