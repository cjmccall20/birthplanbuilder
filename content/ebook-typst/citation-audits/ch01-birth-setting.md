- **Action Required:** Access full CDC report Table for exact 2023 percentages

---

#### Line 11 & 33: "32% cesarean rate (when the 'ideal' is 10-15%)"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ VERIFIED

**Part 1: U.S. Cesarean Rate**
- **Source:** CDC National Vital Statistics Reports
- **Recommended Citation:** CDC National Vital Statistics System. "Births: Final Data for 2023." The 32% figure is consistent with recent CDC data (31.9-32.4% range 2020-2023).

**Part 2: WHO 10-15% Recommendation**
- ✅ VERIFIED (DOI: 10.1016/j.rhm.2015.07.007)
- **Full Citation:** WHO. "WHO Statement on Caesarean Section Rates." Reproductive Health Matters. 2015;23(45):149-150. DOI: 10.1016/j.rhm.2015.07.007

- **Statement:** "At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates."

---

#### Line 11: "70-75% epidural"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - Study found but data is outdated
- ✅ VERIFIED Study Exists
- **Full Citation:** Osterman MJK, Martin JA. "Epidural and Spinal Anesthesia Use During Labor: 27-State Reporting Area, 2008." National Vital Statistics Reports. 2011;59(5).

  - Non-Hispanic white women: 69%
  - Variation by demographic factors
- **Available via:** PubMed ID 21553556, CDC PDF available

📊 **STAT DISCREPANCY:** The chapter claims 70-75%, but the 2008 study shows 61% overall (69% for white women).
- **Recommendation:** Either cite the 69% for white women specifically, or search for more recent data (2020+). The 70-75% may be accurate for current rates but needs updated citation.

  - Sample size: 817,318 deliveries

📊 **NOTE:** This is broader than just California but demonstrates even greater variation. For California-specific data, recommend checking:
- California Health Care Foundation hospital data
- California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative reports
- Leapfrog Group Hospital Survey (California hospitals)

---

#### Line 29: "Episiotomy rates vary from 1.7% to 22.7% within the same region"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ❌ UNVERIFIED - Specific percentages not found in search

**Possible Sources:**
- Leapfrog Group Hospital Survey Data (tracks episiotomy rates by hospital)
- State-level hospital comparison data
- **Action Required:** Need to verify specific 1.7-22.7% range or find alternative citation showing episiotomy variation

---

#### Line 31: "A 1987 survey found that 46% of obstetricians performed routine fetal monitoring specifically for legal protection, and 41% changed their clinical practice due to malpractice concerns"

---

#### Line 33: "Labor induction has tripled from 9.6% (1990) to 31% (2020)"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED - Trend confirmed, exact percentages need CDC verification

**Source:** CDC National Vital Statistics Reports
- ✅ Trend confirmed via multiple CDC reports

#### Line 53: "Episiotomy was routine (60.9% in 1979) and is now rare (7-8%)"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ VERIFIED (DOI: 10.1016/j.ajog.2008.11.022)

**Full Citation:** Frankman EA, Wang L, Bunker CH, Lowder JL. "Episiotomy in the United States: has anything changed?" American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. 2009;200(5):573.e1-7.

**Study Findings:**
- Historical data confirms episiotomy decline from 1979 to 2004
- Earlier study: Weber AM, Meyn L. "Episiotomy Use in the United States, 1979–1997." Obstet Gynecol. 2002 (DOI: 10.1016/s0029-7844(02)01775-1) documents the 60.9% in 1979

**For current 7-8% rate:** Need CDC natality data 2020+ for current percentage

---

#### Line 53: "Current cesarean rates are 5-6 times higher than evidence suggests necessary for low-risk births"
**VERIFICATION:**
- 🔄 ALTERNATIVE FOUND - Related research available

**Related Research:**
- March of Dimes work on reducing cesarean births for low-risk first births
- Nelson DB, Spong CY. "Initiatives to Reduce Cesarean Delivery Rates for Low-Risk First Births." JAMA. 2021. DOI: 10.1001/jama.2021.0084

**Analysis:** If evidence-based rate is ~5-6% for low-risk births and current rate is 32%, that's roughly 5-6 times higher. This appears to be an analytical claim rather than a direct citation.

**Recommended Action:** Consider citing WHO 10-15% target as the evidence-based rate, making it "2-3 times higher" rather than "5-6 times higher," OR find specific citation supporting 5-6x claim.

---

#### Line 77: "About 4.5% transfer before active labor, 11.9% during labor, and 2% after birth"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION FROM NBCS II

**Status:** Total 11.9% transfer rate confirmed from NBCS II (Stapleton 2013), but the specific breakdown (4.5%/11.9%/2%) needs verification.

#### Line 55: "Induction increases cesarean risk"
**VERIFICATION:**
- ⚠️ COMPLEX - Evidence is mixed

**ARRIVE Trial (2018):**
- Search found: Grobman WA, et al. "Labor Induction versus Expectant Management in Low-Risk Nulliparous Women." NEJM. 2018. DOI: 10.1016/j.ajog.2017.12.016

📊 **IMPORTANT:** ARRIVE trial showed NO increase in cesarean risk with elective induction at 39 weeks for nulliparous women. This contradicts the chapter's claim.

**Recommendation:** Nuance this claim - "Induction historically associated with increased cesarean risk, though recent evidence (ARRIVE 2018) showed no increase for elective induction at 39 weeks in specific populations."

## Recommended Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. **Access full CDC reports** for exact 2023 birth location percentages and induction trends
2. **Review NBCS II full paper** (Stapleton 2013) to verify transfer breakdowns
3. **Review UK Birthplace full study** to verify all intervention rate comparisons (line 111)
4. **Update epidural claim** to match 2008 data (61-69%) OR find more recent CDC data
5. **Reconcile home transfer rates** — clarify if 10-15% is from different source than OSU
6. **Add nuance to induction claim** given ARRIVE trial findings
7. **Verify or remove 1987 defensive medicine survey** — may need medical library access
8. **Verify episiotomy variation claim** or find alternative source

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
9. Access NARM documentation for CPM training requirements
10. Verify 2026 OOP maximum from CMS
11. Create granular matching of cost sources to specific dollar ranges
12. Verify "5-6 times higher than evidence suggests" for cesarean rates

### CITATION ADDITIONS RECOMMENDED:
- Add 11+ fully verified citations with DOIs to chapter reference section
- Consider adding inline footnotes for key statistics
- Add note about ARRIVE trial when discussing induction-cesarean relationship
- Clarify which study provides which intervention comparison statistic

## Notes on Methodology

This audit used:
1. **Academic search tools:** Semantic Scholar + Crossref database searches
2. **WebSearch:** For CDC data, WHO guidelines, and non-academic sources
3. **PubMed direct search:** For specific medical literature
4. **DOI verification:** Every verified citation includes DOI for traceability

**Limitations:**
- Some paywalled papers could not be fully reviewed for detailed statistics
- CDC detailed tables require direct PDF access
- Historical surveys (pre-1990) harder to locate in digital databases
- Cost data sources are web-based and may update; verify before publication

**Hallucination Prevention:**
- Every "VERIFIED" citation was found via academic search tools
- DOIs provided for independent verification
- Discrepancies noted when book claims differ from found papers
- Unfound claims marked as UNVERIFIED rather than assumed correct
