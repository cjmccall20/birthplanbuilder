- **Chapters passing:** 8
- **Chapters with issues:** 17

Note: Many "issues" are minor — inaccessible URLs (paywalls, 403 errors) or minor factual nuances rather than fabricated citations. Truly problematic citations are flagged below.

## Chapters with Issues (Requiring Attention)

### 00-introduction.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- Citation [1] (Vinall J, Grunau RE, Frontiers in Pediatrics 2014): Volume listed as "55(3)" is suspicious — Frontiers doesn't use traditional page numbers. Likely a formatting error.
- Citations [1]-[9]: All behind paywalls, unable to directly verify content. Journal names, authors, and years all appear legitimate.

### 05-fetal-monitoring.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **Citation [2] (AAFP 2020):** AUTHOR NAME ERROR — article is by Arnold & Gawrys, NOT "Patel et al." Content and URL are correct.
- **Citation [4] (defensive medicine):** CLAIM INACCURACY — text says "1987 survey found 46% of obstetricians performed routine fetal monitoring for legal concerns." Source actually says 46% of *obstetrical malpractice claims* involved EFM (different meaning). The 41% figure relates to practice changes generally, not fetal monitoring specifically.

### 07-eye-ointment.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **AAP 2024 link:** URL appears to be about erythromycin shortage, not the policy statement cited. Possible link mismatch.
- **Canadian Paediatric Society:** Position statement page has been removed from website. Cannot verify claim that CPS "recommends against routine use."
- **USPSTF 2019:** TEXT MISREPRESENTS SOURCE — USPSTF gives a Grade A recommendation for *universal* prophylaxis, not conditional/selective use. Chapter implies USPSTF supports selective use, which contradicts the actual recommendation.

### 12-circumcision.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **"20,000 nerve endings" claim (line 32):** This figure lacks solid scientific basis. Originated from Paul Fleiss 1997 extrapolation from a 1932 study. Modern estimates range 1,000-10,000. Should be revised or qualified.
- **"2018 study" citing 117 deaths/year (line 174):** YEAR ERROR — this figure comes from Bollinger's 2010 study, not 2018. A separate 2018 Earp et al. study found 1 death per 49,166 circumcisions. Text conflates/misattributes these.
- **Meatal stenosis "17-26%" rate:** Unable to verify specific range. One source showed 1%, another 0.9-11%. The 17-26% figure appears inflated or sourced from a specific subpopulation study.

### 13-unmedicated-birth.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- **Citation [6] (sarahbuckley.com):** Domain not found / inaccessible. Broken URL.
- **Citation [12] (bradleybirth.com):** Redirects to bradleymethod.com but site content not extractable. The "86% unmedicated birth rate" statistic is commonly cited but cannot be independently verified from their website.

### 14-epidural-birth.typ
**STATUS: UNABLE TO FULLY VERIFY**
- Most citations behind paywalls (Cochrane, BMJ, ACOG). All appear legitimate in format. Citation [3] (ACOG Practice Bulletin 209) was verified and confirmed.

### 15-cesarean-birth.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- **Citation [3] (ERAS Society 2025 guidelines):** Specific publication could not be located. The claim about delayed cord clamping safety in cesarean is supported by other studies, but this specific citation needs verification.
- **Citation [4] (WHO 2015):** Text says WHO recommended "15% ceiling" in 2015. Actually, the 2015 WHO statement moved *away* from specific targets. The 10-15% benchmark is from 1985, not 2015.

### 16-feeding.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **Citation [15] (JAMA Pediatrics 2025):** Claims "35% increase in breastfeeding initiation" from IBCLC support. Cannot verify — behind paywall. Year (2025) is recent enough to be plausible.
- **ILCA IBCLC Directory link:** BROKEN URL — "international-lactation.leagueofprofessionalconsultants.com" is wrong. Correct site is ilca.org.
- **Citation [19]:** Appears to conflate two separate sources into one citation.

### 17-labor-induction.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- Most numbered citations lack direct URLs, making verification difficult.
- Citation formats appear legitimate but specific statistics (e.g., membrane sweeping "50% effectiveness," nipple stimulation "37% vs 6%") cannot be independently confirmed without journal access.

### 31-infant-pain-management.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **Citation [2] (Masarwa et al., JAMA Pediatrics 2018):** CANNOT LOCATE — PubMed search returns no results for this author/journal/year combination. May be misattributed to wrong journal.
- **Citation [3] (Ji et al., 2019):** YEAR ERROR — actually published in 2020, not 2019. Study is legitimate (JAMA Psychiatry, PMID: 32044936).
- **"2024 Mount Sinai study":** Attribution unclear; may conflate Alemany et al. 2021 with a different study.

### 37-water-birth.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- **"30-50% pain reduction" claim:** Citation [1] (Cochrane) does NOT quantify pain reduction as 30-50%. Citation [2] (PMC 2024 review) actually found water birth "did not show a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity." This specific claim is not well-supported by the cited sources.
- **Citation [4] (Medical News Today):** URL returns HTTP 500 error. Inaccessible.

### 38-vbac.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- **Citation [5] (VBAC calculator overestimates):** Specific figures (63.6% predicted vs 51.1% actual) could not be verified from the Medscape source, though the general claim about overestimation with induction was confirmed.
- **Citation [7] (racial bias in VBAC calculators):** Incomplete verification — agent ran out before completing this check.

### 39-cascade-interventions.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- **Pitocin fetal heart rate statistics (32% vs 17%):** Referenced from birthindueseason.org but these specific numbers are not directly visible on the page. May be in linked infographics not captured by web fetch.
- **Epidural statistics (52% vs 38%):** Same issue — referenced from birthindueseason.org but not directly verifiable in page text.

### 40-childbirth-education.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND (minor)**
- **Citation [1] (Hodnett, Cochrane 2013):** Author/date may be incorrect. The relevant Cochrane review is Bohren MA et al. 2017, not Hodnett 2013.
- **Bradley Method "86% success rate":** Commonly cited but not found on current Bradley Method website. Original source unclear.

### 41-microbiome.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- Agent completed verification but detailed findings were truncated. Multiple PMC links were verified as accessible and supporting claims.

### 42-informed-refusal.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- Agent completed verification but detailed findings were truncated. Legal citations appear legitimate based on format.

### 43-doula-support.typ
**STATUS: ISSUES FOUND**
- Agent completed verification but detailed findings were truncated. Multiple links verified as accessible.

- **09-vitamin-k.typ** — PASS (CDC, AAP, Cochrane, PMC sources all verified; NEJM behind paywall but legitimate)
- **10-hepatitis-b.typ** — PASS (CDC, AAP, WHO sources all verified and supporting claims; one JHU link inaccessible)
- **11-cord-clamping.typ** — PASS (ACOG, WHO, PMC sources verified; two ScienceDirect links behind paywall)

## Priority Fixes (Most Serious)

These are citations where the claim in the text is materially wrong or the source contradicts what's written:

1. **Ch 07 (Eye Ointment):** USPSTF actually recommends *universal* prophylaxis, not selective. Text misrepresents.
2. **Ch 37 (Water Birth):** "30-50% pain reduction" is not supported by the cited Cochrane review or the 2024 PMC review.
3. **Ch 05 (Fetal Monitoring):** "46% of obstetricians" claim misreads the source (it's 46% of *malpractice claims*, not obstetricians).
4. **Ch 12 (Circumcision):** "20,000 nerve endings" lacks scientific basis; death rate study year is wrong (2010, not 2018).
5. **Ch 31 (Infant Pain):** Masarwa citation cannot be located in JAMA Pediatrics; Ji et al. year is wrong (2020, not 2019).
6. **Ch 05 (Fetal Monitoring):** Author attribution wrong for AAFP article (Arnold & Gawrys, not Patel et al.).
7. **Ch 16 (Feeding):** ILCA directory link is broken (wrong domain entirely).

## Secondary Fixes (Minor)

8. **Ch 00 (Intro):** Fix Frontiers in Pediatrics volume/page format
9. **Ch 15 (Cesarean):** Correct WHO 2015 characterization (they moved away from specific targets, not toward 15%)
10. **Ch 40 (Childbirth Ed):** Hodnett Cochrane citation may need updating to Bohren 2017
11. **Ch 38 (VBAC):** Verify specific calculator numbers (63.6% vs 51.1%)
12. **Ch 13 (Unmedicated):** Fix broken sarahbuckley.com link
