# GBS (Group B Strep) and Antibiotics: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
GBS is a common bacteria carried by 15-35% of pregnant women. IV antibiotics during labor reduce early-onset GBS disease in babies by 83%, but also disrupt your baby's developing gut microbiome at a critical time for immune development.

## What It Is
- Bacteria found in vagina/rectum of many healthy women
- Screening test at 35-37 weeks of pregnancy
- If positive: IV antibiotics recommended during labor
- About 1% of untreated GBS-positive babies develop serious infection
- Antibiotics reduce this to about 0.17%

## Key Risk Factors That Increase Your Baseline Risk
- **African American/Black race** (2-3x higher disease rates)
- **Maternal age under 20**
- **Previous baby with GBS disease**
- **GBS found in urine during pregnancy**
- **Prolonged rupture of membranes (18+ hours)**
- **Fever during labor**
- **Preterm delivery**

**Important:** If you DON'T have these risk factors, your individual risk may be LOWER than the 1:200 baseline.

## Trade-Off You're Weighing
- **Antibiotics prevent:** Rare but serious infection (blood infection, pneumonia, meningitis)
- **Antibiotics disrupt:** Baby's gut bacteria establishment, linked to increased eczema (81%), allergies, and immune issues

## Alternatives
- **Probiotics during pregnancy:** May reduce GBS colonization by 44%, but no proof they reduce disease
- **Chlorhexidine (Hibiclens) vaginal wash:** Some evidence, but less effective than IV antibiotics
- **Retest closer to due date:** GBS can come and go; you may clear it naturally
- **Risk-based approach:** Wait to see if risk factors develop during labor

## If You Get Antibiotics: Mitigation
- **Breastfeed** (most important for microbiome recovery)
- Give baby **Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics** for 3-6 months
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotics in baby's first year

## What to Say
"I understand antibiotics dramatically reduce GBS risk. Given my specific risk factors [list them], what is MY individual risk without antibiotics? Can we discuss alternatives and mitigation strategies?"

## One Thing to Remember
This is a real trade-off between immediate infection risk and long-term microbiome effects. Neither choice is wrong. Understanding YOUR specific risk factors (not population averages) helps you decide what's right for you.
