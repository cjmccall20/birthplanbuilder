# Circumcision: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Circumcision is not medically necessary. It's a painful surgical procedure performed on a newborn in his first days of life—a time when early experiences may affect developing brain regions. The decision is cultural, religious, or personal—not medical. The US is the only developed country with high routine circumcision rates.

## What It Is
- Surgical removal of the foreskin (prepuce)
- Usually done 1-2 days after birth
- Permanent—cannot be undone
- Removes ~50% of penile skin and specialized nerve tissue

## Key Stats
- US circumcision rate: ~55-65%
- Europe circumcision rate: <5%
- AAP position: Benefits don't justify routine recommendation
- Complications: ~1.5-3% (bleeding, infection, rarely more serious)

## The Pain & Trauma Reality
- Cortisol levels spike 3-4x during the procedure
- Studies show altered pain responses in circumcised infants months later
- Research on early life pain suggests it affects developing brain regions connected to emotion and stress
- Even with anesthesia, pain is reduced but not eliminated
- Some hospitals still don't routinely offer pain relief—always ask

## The Claims vs Evidence
**Claimed:** Reduces UTI risk → Reality: 100 circumcisions prevent 1 UTI; UTIs are treatable with antibiotics
**Claimed:** Reduces STI/HIV risk → Reality: Based on African studies; condoms are far more effective
**Claimed:** Easier to clean → Reality: The foreskin is self-cleaning; normal hygiene takes seconds

## Decision Guide
**Consider circumcision if:** Religious requirement (Jewish/Muslim), strong cultural/family preference—ensure pain management is provided
**Consider keeping intact if:** No religious requirement, concerns about early life pain/trauma, want to preserve natural anatomy, prioritize bodily autonomy

## One Thing to Remember
No medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision. Your newborn's first days are his introduction to the world outside the womb. Consider whether a painful surgical procedure is how you want those days to begin.
