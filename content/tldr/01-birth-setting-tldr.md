# Birth Setting: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
For low-risk pregnancies, hospitals have the highest intervention rates, birth centers are middle ground, home births have the lowest. All three have similar safety outcomes for low-risk women with qualified attendants.

## Key Stats
- Hospital vaginal birth rate: ~70% | Birth center: ~85% | Home birth: ~95%
- Hospital epidural rate: ~73% | Birth center: ~5% | Home birth: ~0%
- Hospital transfer rate: N/A | Birth center: ~12% | Home birth: ~16%

## Quick Decision Guide
**Choose hospital if:** High-risk pregnancy, want epidural available, feel safer with full medical resources
**Choose birth center if:** Low-risk, want less intervention, value midwifery model, want hospital backup nearby
**Choose home birth if:** Low-risk, experienced mom, want full control, have qualified midwife with transfer plan

## One Thing to Remember
The setting you choose affects the care you receive. Hospitals are designed for emergencies, which means routine births often get treated as potential emergencies.
