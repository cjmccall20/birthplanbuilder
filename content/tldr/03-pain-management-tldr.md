# Pain Management: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Pain management is a spectrum from fully unmedicated to epidural. Each option has trade-offs. Decide BEFORE labor—when contractions hit, you want your choice already made.

## The Spectrum (Least → Most Intervention)
1. **Unmedicated:** Movement, water, breathing, massage, mental techniques
2. **Nitrous oxide:** You control it, wears off quickly, doesn't affect baby
3. **IV opioids:** Short-acting, crosses placenta, can make baby sleepy
4. **Epidural:** Most effective pain relief, limits mobility, intervention cascade risk

## Key Stats
- US epidural rate: ~73%
- Epidural → C-section risk increase: ~2.5x
- Doula support reduces epidural rate by: ~57%

## Quick Decision Guide
**Unmedicated works best with:** Preparation (childbirth class), continuous support (doula), freedom to move, water access
**Epidural makes sense if:** You want guaranteed pain relief, long labor is exhausting you, labor is particularly intense
**Consider nitrous if:** Want some relief, want to stay mobile, want to keep options open

## One Thing to Remember
Most women who achieve unmedicated birth do so through preparation, not pain tolerance. It's a learned skill, not willpower.
