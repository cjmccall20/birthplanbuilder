# Cord Clamping: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Delayed cord clamping (waiting until the cord stops pulsing, ~1-3 minutes) gives baby 30% more blood volume and 50% more iron. ACOG recommends it. There's no good reason to clamp immediately.

## What It Is
- "Immediate clamping": Within 15-30 seconds
- "Delayed clamping": 1-3+ minutes, or until cord stops pulsing
- The cord naturally transfers blood from placenta to baby after birth

## Key Stats
- Blood volume increase with delayed clamping: 30%
- Iron stores at 6 months: Significantly higher
- Brain myelination (4 months): Improved
- Phototherapy for jaundice: Very slight increase (not clinically significant)

## What Organizations Say
- ACOG: Recommends delayed clamping (at least 30-60 seconds)
- WHO: Recommends 1-3 minutes minimum
- AAP: Supports delayed clamping

## What to Say
"We want delayed cord clamping until the cord stops pulsing or for at least 2-3 minutes."

## C-Section Note
Delayed clamping is still possible during C-section. May be slightly shorter (60-90 seconds) but still beneficial.

## One Thing to Remember
Immediate clamping became standard for convenience, not evidence. Your baby's blood belongs in your baby, not in the placenta.
