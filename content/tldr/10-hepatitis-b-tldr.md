# Hepatitis B Vaccine: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Hep B vaccine at birth is primarily to catch babies of mothers who test falsely negative or have unknown status. If you're confirmed HepB-negative, the 2025 ACIP guidelines now support individual decision-making about timing.

## What It Is
- Hepatitis B is a liver disease spread through blood/body fluids
- Babies infected at birth have 90% chance of chronic infection
- Vaccine is given within 24 hours of birth (standard)

## Key Stats
- Maternal-infant transmission (if mom is HepB+): 40-90%
- Chronic infection if infected at birth: 90%
- US maternal HepB+ rate: <1%
- 2025 policy change: Individual decision for HepB-negative mothers

## The 2025 Change
ACIP now recommends "individual-based decision-making" for birth dose when:
- Mother tested negative during pregnancy
- No household contacts are HepB+
- Vaccine can be given at 2-month visit instead

## Decision Guide
**Birth dose makes sense if:** Unknown maternal status, high-risk household contacts, want to start series early
**Delaying to 2 months may be considered if:** Confirmed maternal negative status, stable family situation, prefer fewer interventions at birth

## One Thing to Remember
Transmission requires an infected source. If you're confirmed negative and your household is too, your newborn has no exposure risk. The vaccine still makes sense eventually—the question is just timing.
