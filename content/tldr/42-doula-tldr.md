# Doula Support: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
A doula is a trained professional who provides continuous support during labor. They're one of the most evidence-based interventions in obstetrics: 39% reduction in C-sections, shorter labor, less pain medication, higher satisfaction. If you can access one, you should.

## What Doulas Do
- **Physical:** Massage, positioning, counter-pressure, breathing support
- **Emotional:** Reassurance, calm presence, encouragement
- **Informational:** Explain what's happening, translate medical terms
- **Advocacy:** Remind staff of your preferences, help you make informed decisions
- **Partner support:** Show your partner how to help, give them breaks

## What Doulas DON'T Do
- NOT medical providers (no cervical checks, fetal monitoring, or medical decisions)
- NOT replacement for your partner (they support BOTH of you)
- NOT there to push an agenda (they support YOUR choices)

## The Evidence
From Cochrane review of ~16,000 women:
- **39% reduction in C-sections** (when support from doula specifically)
- **41 minutes shorter labor** on average
- **10% less pain medication use**
- **31% fewer negative birth experiences**
- **38% lower risk of low Apgar scores**
- **No adverse effects**

Recent studies (2022-2025) confirm: 47-68% lower cesarean risk, 57% lower postpartum depression risk, 29% lower preterm birth risk.

## Cost & Coverage
- **Private doula:** $800-$2,500 (varies by location/experience)
- **Free options:** Community programs in many cities (NYC, Philadelphia, San Diego, Arizona, etc.)
- **Medicaid:** Covered in some states (CA, MD, MI, MN, NJ, NV, OR, VA, DC)
- **Employer benefits:** Carrot, Maven, Progyny, Walmart, Microsoft, CVS, PNC Bank
- **FSA/HSA:** May cover with Letter of Medical Necessity from your provider

## How to Find One
- DONA International (dona.org) or CAPPA (cappa.net) directories
- Ask your midwife/OB for recommendations
- Check for community doula programs in your area
- Doulas-in-training offer reduced rates ($200-$500)
- Hospital volunteer programs (if available)

## Questions to Ask When Interviewing
1. How many births have you attended?
2. Are you certified? By which organization?
3. What's your birth philosophy?
4. How do you work with partners?
5. What's your fee and what does it include?
6. Do you have a backup doula?
7. Have you worked at my planned birth location?

## Doula + Partner = Team
Your partner provides emotional connection, love, and intimacy. Your doula provides professional experience, physical techniques, and objective perspective. They work together—doulas enhance your partner's ability to support you, they don't replace them.

## Special Situations
- **Planned C-section:** Doulas can still support you (emotional prep, advocacy, recovery support)
- **VBAC:** Higher success rates with doula support
- **High-risk pregnancy:** Doulas work alongside medical teams
- **Twins/multiples:** Some doulas charge extra $200-$500

## Why It Works
Labor responds to environment and support. Continuous support reduces stress hormones, keeps oxytocin flowing, and helps labor progress naturally. One person focused entirely on YOUR comfort and emotional state makes a measurable physiologic difference.

## Our Take
This is one of the most evidence-based interventions in modern obstetrics. We've over-invested in technology and under-invested in human support. Doula support should be standard care, not optional luxury care.

If you can access doula support—whether through insurance, community programs, or paying out of pocket—the evidence says you should take it.

## One Thing to Remember
Continuous labor support isn't a luxury or a "nice to have." It's an evidence-based intervention that improves outcomes without side effects. Your body works better when you feel supported, safe, and informed.
