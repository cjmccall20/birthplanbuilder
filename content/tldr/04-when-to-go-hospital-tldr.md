# When to Go to Hospital: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Arriving too early = more interventions. Labor at home as long as safely possible. The 5-1-1 rule (contractions 5 min apart, 1 min long, for 1 hour) is a starting point, not a rule.

## When to GO
- Contractions consistently 3-4 minutes apart, lasting 60+ seconds, for 1+ hour
- You can't talk or walk through contractions
- You feel intense pressure or urge to push
- Water breaks AND contractions are strong
- You're GBS+ and need antibiotics (go when labor is established)

## When to GO IMMEDIATELY (Warning Signs)
- Bright red bleeding (not just bloody show)
- Baby not moving normally
- Water breaks and is green/brown (meconium)
- Severe headache or vision changes
- Fever

## Key Stats
- Admission at 4cm vs 6cm: 2x higher C-section rate at 4cm
- Average first-time labor: 12-18 hours
- 20% of labors start with water breaking

## One Thing to Remember
The intervention clock starts when you're admitted. Every hour in the hospital = more pressure to "progress." Being home in early labor = working with your body's timeline.
