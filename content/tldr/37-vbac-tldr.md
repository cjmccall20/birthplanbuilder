# VBAC: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
For most women with one prior cesarean, VBAC should be the default. Success rates are 60-80%, uterine rupture risk is under 1%, and benefits include faster recovery and avoiding cumulative surgical risks. "Once a cesarean, always a cesarean" is outdated.

## Key Stats
- VBAC success rate: 60-80% overall | 79% with spontaneous labor | 66% with induction
- Uterine rupture risk: 0.5-0.7% (less than 1 in 143) with low-transverse incision
- U.S. VBAC rate: Only 14% (access problem, not safety issue)

## Quick Decision Guide
**Good VBAC candidates:** One prior low-transverse cesarean, 18+ months since cesarean, previous vaginal birth (especially strong predictor), non-recurring reason for prior cesarean, spontaneous labor

**Not VBAC candidates:** Classical (vertical upper uterine) incision, previous uterine rupture, T-shaped or inverted-J incision, contraindications to vaginal birth

## Finding VBAC Support
**Questions to ask providers:** "Do you support TOLAC? What are your personal VBAC success rates? Do you support spontaneous labor or recommend induction?"

**Red flags:** Provider discourages VBAC, hospital VBAC ban, strict arbitrary time limits on labor, low facility TOLAC rates (under 30%)

## Maximizing Success
- Choose VBAC-supportive provider (most important factor)
- Avoid induction if possible (spontaneous labor has 13% higher success rate)
- Hire experienced doula
- Wait to go to hospital until active labor
- Be patient with labor progress

## One Thing to Remember
Provider and hospital choice may matter more than your individual risk factors. VBAC success rates vary from 15% to 85% between different hospitals, not because patients are different, but because support levels are different.
