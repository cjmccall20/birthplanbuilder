# GBS Antibiotics: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
GBS antibiotics reduce early-onset infection by ~83%, but they disrupt baby's gut microbiome. For GBS+ mothers, it's a real trade-off. Probiotics during pregnancy may reduce colonization.

## What GBS Is
- Group B Strep: bacteria in vagina/rectum of ~25% of women
- Usually harmless to mom
- Can cause serious infection in ~1-2% of exposed babies
- Testing happens at 35-37 weeks

## Key Stats
- GBS infection WITHOUT antibiotics: 1-2%
- GBS infection WITH antibiotics: 0.2%
- Microbiome disruption: Documented at 1 year
- Eczema increase with >24hr antibiotics: Documented

## Options If GBS+
1. **IV antibiotics in labor** (standard): Most protective against infection
2. **Probiotics during pregnancy:** May reduce GBS colonization by 44-50%
3. **Decline antibiotics:** Higher infection risk but preserves microbiome (some choose this if labor is fast)

## Mitigation If You Get Antibiotics
- Breastfeed (most important for microbiome recovery)
- Consider infant probiotics
- Delay bathing
- Maximize skin-to-skin

## One Thing to Remember
This isn't an easy yes/no. Weigh the small but serious infection risk against the documented microbiome effects. Your birth circumstances matter (fast labor = less antibiotic exposure).
