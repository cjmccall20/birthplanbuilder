# Vaginal vs C-Section: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Vaginal birth has significant benefits for baby's microbiome, maternal recovery, and future pregnancies. C-sections are lifesaving when medically necessary but are overused. The US C-section rate (32%) is nearly double the WHO recommended rate.

## Key Stats
- C-section rate US: 32% | WHO recommended: 10-15%
- Recovery time: Vaginal 1-2 weeks | C-section 4-6 weeks
- Risk of major complications: Vaginal lower | C-section 3x higher

## Quick Decision Guide
**C-section is necessary for:** Placenta previa, cord prolapse, true fetal distress, some breech presentations
**C-section is often NOT necessary for:** "Big baby" (often inaccurate), "failure to progress" (often timing), prior C-section (VBAC is often safe)

## If C-Section Happens
Ask about: Delayed cord clamping, immediate skin-to-skin, clear drape to see baby, music in OR, gentle/family-centered approach

## One Thing to Remember
Vaginal seeding (for C-section babies) is promising but still experimental. Breastfeeding is the most important microbiome intervention for C-section babies.
