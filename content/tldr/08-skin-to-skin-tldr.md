# Skin-to-Skin / Golden Hour: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Immediate skin-to-skin contact after birth regulates baby's temperature, heart rate, and breathing, promotes breastfeeding, and triggers bonding hormones. Most procedures can wait. Keep baby on your chest.

## What It Is
- Baby placed directly on mother's bare chest immediately after birth
- "Golden hour" = first 60 minutes of uninterrupted contact
- Both vaginal and C-section births can include skin-to-skin

## Key Stats
- Breastfeeding success increase: Significant
- Temperature regulation: Better than warmer
- Crying reduction: Immediate
- Blood sugar stabilization: Documented

## What Can Wait
- Vitamin K shot (can wait 1-2 hours)
- Eye ointment (can wait)
- Weighing and measuring
- First bath (can wait 24+ hours)
- Footprints

## What Should NOT Wait (If Needed)
- Resuscitation if baby isn't breathing well
- Suctioning if severe meconium
- Treatment for immediate complications

## What to Say
"We want immediate skin-to-skin and for baby to stay with me for at least the first hour. Please do any assessments with baby on my chest."

## One Thing to Remember
This isn't a nice-to-have—it's biologically optimal. Your body is baby's best incubator. Fight for this time.
