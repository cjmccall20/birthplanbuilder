# Fetal Monitoring: TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) increases C-section rates by ~20% without improving outcomes for low-risk pregnancies. Intermittent auscultation (listening periodically) is evidence-based for low-risk births.

## Two Options
**Continuous EFM:** Belts strapped on constantly, paper printout, restricts movement
**Intermittent auscultation:** Doppler or fetoscope every 15-30 min in labor, every 5 min in pushing

## Key Stats
- Continuous EFM → C-section increase: 63%
- Cerebral palsy prevention from continuous EFM: NONE
- US births with continuous EFM: 89%

## Quick Decision Guide
**Intermittent monitoring is appropriate if:** Low-risk pregnancy, no Pitocin, no epidural, normal labor progress
**Continuous monitoring may be needed if:** High-risk pregnancy, Pitocin augmentation, epidural in place, concerning heart tones

## What to Ask
"I'd like intermittent monitoring. Is there a medical reason I need continuous monitoring right now?"

## One Thing to Remember
Continuous monitoring doesn't improve outcomes—it just gives more data to potentially misinterpret. It became standard for liability protection, not better care.
