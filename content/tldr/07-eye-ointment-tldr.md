# Eye Ointment (Erythromycin): TL;DR

## Bottom Line
Eye ointment prevents gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission to baby's eyes. If you've tested negative for both STIs, your baby has zero risk of these infections. The AAP is reconsidering mandatory status.

## What It Is
- Antibiotic ointment applied to newborn's eyes within 1-2 hours of birth
- Prevents gonococcal/chlamydial ophthalmia (eye infection)
- Required by law in most US states
- Blurs baby's vision during critical bonding hour

## Key Stats
- Gonorrhea/chlamydia transmission to baby (if mom is infected): 30-50%
- If mom tested negative during pregnancy: ~0%
- AAP 2024 position: Calling for re-evaluation of mandatory prophylaxis

## Decision Guide
**If you tested positive** for gonorrhea or chlamydia: Get the ointment (essential)
**If you tested negative** AND are in a monogamous relationship: Risk is essentially zero; ointment provides no benefit
**If your state requires it:** You may need to sign a waiver to decline (or it may not be possible to decline)

## What to Ask
"I tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Is there a medical reason my baby needs this?"

## One Thing to Remember
This is one of the few interventions where testing status completely determines risk. Negative = no transmission possible = ointment is unnecessary.
