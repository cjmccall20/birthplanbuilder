# Eating and Drinking During Labor

## THE QUICK ANSWER

The old rule of "nothing by mouth" during labor is outdated. Current evidence supports light eating and drinking during labor for low-risk women. Your body is doing hard work—it needs fuel.

## WHAT IT IS

Many hospitals still restrict food and drink during labor, limiting women to ice chips. This policy originated in the 1940s when general anesthesia for cesareans carried a risk of aspiration (inhaling stomach contents). Modern anesthesia techniques have made this risk extremely rare.

The question is simple: Should you eat and drink during labor, or fast?

## THE EVIDENCE

**The aspiration fear:**
- The original concern was Mendelson's syndrome—aspiration during general anesthesia
- Modern cesareans almost always use regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal), not general
- When general anesthesia is needed, techniques have improved dramatically
- A 2013 Cochrane review found no cases of aspiration in any of the studies examined
- The actual risk is estimated at 0.7 per million—about the same as being struck by lightning

**What happens when you don't eat:**
- Labor is physically demanding, comparable to a marathon
- Fasting leads to ketosis (your body burning fat for fuel), which can cause nausea and fatigue
- Low energy can slow labor and reduce your ability to push effectively
- Dehydration requires IV fluids, which limits mobility

**What the evidence says:**
- ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) now supports "modest amounts of clear liquids" for low-risk women
- The UK and many European countries have allowed eating during labor for years
- Studies show no increased complications from eating during labor for low-risk women

**What counts as low-risk:**
- No anticipated need for general anesthesia
- Normal labor progression
- No diabetes or other conditions affecting digestion

## OUR TAKE

Eat lightly in early labor. Drink throughout labor. Listen to your body.

**Good options:**
- Toast, crackers, fruit
- Broth, juice, sports drinks
- Honey sticks for quick energy
- Popsicles

**As labor intensifies:** Most women naturally lose interest in food during active labor. That's fine—but keep drinking.

**If the hospital restricts you:** Ask why. "What's the specific medical reason for this restriction in my case?" If you're low-risk, the honest answer is often "hospital policy" rather than medical necessity.

**The practical reality:** Even if you eat, you probably won't want much once active labor begins. But having a light snack during early labor gives you energy reserves for the hard work ahead.

Your body knows how to do this. Feed it.
