# Newborn Screening (Heel Prick Test)

## THE QUICK ANSWER

The newborn screening test checks for rare but serious conditions that are treatable if caught early. The benefits are significant. However, the procedure is painful for your baby—expect crying—and some states store the blood samples indefinitely with concerning privacy implications. We recommend doing it, but be informed about what it involves.

## WHAT IT IS

Within 24-48 hours of birth, blood is collected from your baby's heel by pricking it with a lancet and squeezing out multiple droplets onto a filter paper card. This isn't a quick finger prick—the technician must fill several circles on the card, which requires sustained squeezing of your baby's heel. The test screens for 30-50 conditions (varies by state), mostly metabolic and genetic disorders that cause no symptoms at birth but can lead to serious problems if untreated.

## THE EVIDENCE

**Why this test matters:**
- PKU (phenylketonuria): Without detection, causes severe intellectual disability. With early dietary treatment, children develop normally.
- Congenital hypothyroidism: Undetected, causes developmental delays. With thyroid hormone replacement, normal development.
- Sickle cell disease: Early detection allows preventive care that significantly reduces complications.
- SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency): Fatal without treatment; curable with early bone marrow transplant.

**The numbers:** About 1 in 300 babies screened has a condition detected. For most of these children, early treatment prevents serious harm.

**The pain reality:**
This procedure hurts. Research shows significant increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, and cortisol levels during and after the heel stick. Your baby will likely cry—sometimes intensely. Studies have found that infants who experienced prior painful procedures showed greater pain responses during subsequent heel pricks, with longer crying times and higher pain scores.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't do the test—the medical benefits outweigh the brief pain. But you should be prepared for it and know how to help your baby cope.

**Early life pain matters:**
Research published in Frontiers in Pediatrics shows that procedural pain in early life can affect developing brain regions, particularly areas connected to the limbic system. While a single heel prick is not comparable to the repeated procedures NICU babies experience, minimizing unnecessary pain and providing comfort during necessary procedures is important.

## PRIVACY CONCERNS: STATE BLOOD SPOT STORAGE

This is a significant issue many parents don't know about.

**What happens to the blood sample after testing?**

States vary dramatically in how long they retain your baby's blood spots:
- **California:** Stores samples indefinitely (9.5+ million since 2000) without parental consent
- **Texas:** Was storing indefinitely until a 2009 lawsuit forced destruction of 5 million samples
- **Minnesota:** A 2011 court ruling required destruction of 1.1 million samples stored without proper consent
- **New Jersey:** Starting November 2024, destroying samples older than 2 years after lawsuit revelations
- **Some states:** Destroy samples within months

**Why this matters:**
- Law enforcement has used newborn blood spots for criminal investigations (including the Golden State Killer case)
- More than a quarter of states have no policy barring law enforcement access
- Advances in genetic technology mean these samples can reveal increasingly sensitive information—from ancestry to disease predispositions
- The ACLU warns that "widespread newborn DNA sequencing will worsen risks to genetic privacy"

**What you can do:**
- Ask your state's policy on retention and research use
- Most states allow you to request sample destruction after testing
- Some states have opt-out forms for research use
- Know that opting out of storage doesn't mean opting out of the screening itself

## HOW TO REDUCE YOUR BABY'S PAIN

A Cochrane review of 36 studies found that **breastfeeding during the heel prick significantly reduces pain**. Babies who breastfed during the procedure showed:
- Lower heart rates
- Shorter crying duration (reduced by up to 98% in one study)
- Lower pain scores on standardized scales

**If you're breastfeeding:** Request that the test be done while baby is actively nursing. This is the single most effective non-pharmacological pain intervention.

**If you're not breastfeeding:** Skin-to-skin contact during the procedure also reduces pain significantly. Hold your baby against your chest.

**Other strategies:**
- Ensure baby is warm (cold increases pain response)
- Ask for the test when baby is calm, not already crying
- Stay present and provide comfort
- Know that the intense crying is temporary

## OUR TAKE

Do the newborn screening. The conditions it catches are rare but devastating when missed, and early treatment makes a life-changing difference.

**But do it informed:**

1. **Request breastfeeding or skin-to-skin during the procedure.** This significantly reduces your baby's pain.

2. **Be prepared for crying.** This isn't a gentle prick—it's multiple blood drops squeezed from your baby's heel. It will hurt. It will be hard to watch. Your baby will recover, but don't be blindsided.

3. **Ask about your state's blood spot storage policy.** If indefinite storage concerns you, request destruction of the sample after testing is complete. The screening is still worth doing—you're just protecting your child's genetic privacy.

4. **Time it right.** After the golden hour, between 24-48 hours. Not during feeding or sleep if you can help it (unless you're breastfeeding through it).

The test is a yes. How it's done matters too.
