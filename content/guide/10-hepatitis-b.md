# Hepatitis B Vaccine at Birth

## One-Page Overview

The hepatitis B vaccine has been given to newborns in the United States for over 30 years, preventing an estimated 99% of pediatric hepatitis B infections. In December 2025, the CDC changed its recommendation: for babies born to mothers who test negative for hepatitis B during pregnancy, parents and providers can now decide together whether to vaccinate at birth or wait until the 2-month visit.

This change has sparked controversy. The American Academy of Pediatrics called it "irresponsible" and continues to recommend the birth dose for all newborns. New York State rejected the new guidance entirely.

**The bottom line:** If you test negative for hepatitis B during pregnancy, you now have a choice. The birth dose offers immediate protection with an excellent safety record. Delaying to 2 months is also effective if you complete the full series. Both approaches work when followed through—the key is understanding your specific situation and making sure your baby gets all three doses.

## What Is Hepatitis B?

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that damages the liver. Unlike a brief illness that comes and goes, hepatitis B can establish a lifelong infection in the body if it is not cleared by the immune system.

### How It Spreads

Hepatitis B spreads when blood or body fluids from an infected person enter someone else's body. The main routes are:

- **Blood exposure:** Through needlestick injuries, shared needles, or contact with infected blood through cuts or sores
- **Sexual transmission:** The most common route for adults in developed countries
- **Mother-to-child (perinatal):** During pregnancy, labor, or delivery—this is the primary concern for newborns
- **Household contact:** The virus can survive on surfaces for more than 7 days, so transmission can occur through shared personal items like toothbrushes or razors if they contain infected blood

### Why Infants Are Especially Vulnerable

Here is the most important fact about hepatitis B and babies: **approximately 90% of infants infected at birth develop chronic lifelong infection.**

This is dramatically different from adults. When an adult catches hepatitis B, their immune system typically fights it off within six months. Only 2-6% of infected adults develop chronic infection.

Babies are the opposite. Their immune systems simply cannot clear the virus the way an older child or adult can. This 90% chronic infection rate is the main reason the birth dose has been recommended for three decades.

### What Chronic Infection Means

Chronic hepatitis B means the virus stays in the body indefinitely. Many children with chronic infection feel fine and grow normally for years. But the virus causes slow, progressive liver damage over decades.

Long-term consequences include:
- **Cirrhosis:** Scarring of the liver that can lead to liver failure
- **Liver cancer:** Hepatitis B is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide after tobacco
- **Early death:** About 15-25% of people infected at birth will die from liver disease if untreated

## The 2025 Policy Change

### What ACIP Now Recommends

On December 16, 2025, the CDC formally adopted a new approach to the hepatitis B birth dose. Here is what changed:

**For babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose status is unknown:**
- Nothing changed. These babies should receive the hepatitis B vaccine AND hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth.

**For babies born to mothers who test negative during pregnancy:**
- Parents and providers can now decide together whether to give the vaccine at birth or begin the series at the 2-month visit.

This represents a shift from universal recommendation to individual decision-making for one specific group: babies born to mothers with confirmed negative test results.

### What This Means for You

If you are pregnant and test negative for hepatitis B, you now have a choice about timing. The vaccine series is still recommended—the question is whether it starts at birth or at the 2-month visit.

If your hepatitis B status is unknown or positive, the recommendation remains the same: your baby should receive the vaccine (and HBIG if you are positive) within 12 hours of birth.

## The Case for the Birth Dose

### The 90% Chronic Infection Risk

The most compelling argument for the birth dose is simple math: if a newborn is exposed to hepatitis B and not vaccinated, there is a 9 in 10 chance they will develop lifelong infection with serious consequences.

The birth dose prevents infection at the moment of greatest vulnerability.

### Catch-Up for Missed Screening

The birth dose serves as a safety net for gaps in prenatal screening. While screening is highly accurate, it is not perfect:
- Research suggests 10-16% of pregnant people are not tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy
- Some mothers deliver in settings where prenatal records are unavailable
- Early screening rates are lower, with only 60% of commercially insured and 39% of Medicaid-enrolled women tested in the first trimester

For mothers who were not adequately screened, the birth dose provides immediate protection.

### Household Transmission Protection

Even if you test negative, the vaccine protects against an unknown risk: household members who may have hepatitis B without knowing it. About 50% of people in the United States with hepatitis B are unaware of their infection. If an undiagnosed household member transmits the virus through blood contact, a vaccinated infant would be protected.

### 30 Years of Safety Data

The hepatitis B vaccine has one of the most extensively studied safety records of any childhood vaccine. After millions of doses given to newborns, the CDC has not detected any unexpected safety concerns.

### The AAP's Position

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the nation's largest pediatrician organization, strongly opposes the 2025 change. They call the new guidance "irresponsible" and "purposely misleading." The AAP continues to recommend routine hepatitis B vaccination for all newborns without delay.

## The Case for Delaying

### If Mom Is Hepatitis B Negative: Zero Risk at Birth

The central argument for allowing delay is straightforward: perinatal transmission happens when a mother has hepatitis B and transmits the virus to her baby during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. If the mother does not have hepatitis B, this route cannot occur.

**For a baby born to a mother with a confirmed negative test, the risk of perinatal transmission is zero.** Not low. Zero. You cannot transmit what you do not have.

### Reliability of Prenatal Screening

The test for hepatitis B (called HBsAg) has sensitivity and specificity greater than 98%. This means:
- If you test positive, you almost certainly have hepatitis B
- If you test negative, you almost certainly do not

A negative test is genuinely reassuring. The CDC committee relied heavily on this accuracy when making the 2025 change.

### Understanding How Hepatitis B Actually Spreads

Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact and sexual contact. These routes are simply not relevant for newborns in typical family situations.

For a newborn with a hepatitis B-negative mother:
- **No perinatal transmission** (mother doesn't have the virus)
- **No sexual transmission** (irrelevant for infants)
- **Household transmission requires** an infected household member with blood exposure

The only realistic risk is if an undiagnosed household member has hepatitis B and there is blood contact (shared toothbrush, contact with open wounds, etc.). This risk is real but quite low in the United States, where hepatitis B prevalence is less than 1%.

### Why Was Universal Birth Vaccination Adopted?

The birth dose was adopted in 1991 not because all newborns face immediate risk, but for two practical reasons:

1. **To catch babies whose mothers were not tested or tested falsely negative** (the "safety net" argument)
2. **Because newborns in the hospital represent a "captive audience"** where vaccination can be reliably administered before discharge

The second reason is particularly important to understand. The birth dose was chosen partly because it guarantees vaccination happens—not because there is medical urgency for day-one protection in babies born to hepatitis B-negative mothers.

### Concerns About Waning Immunity

One concern raised during the 2025 ACIP vote was that vaccine immunity may wane over time. ACIP member Dr. Meissner noted that "giving one dose and then letting a child become susceptible later in subsequent years" could represent harm.

This raises a valid question: **if you vaccinate at birth, will immunity last through adolescence and adulthood when actual risk begins?**

Some research suggests antibody levels decline over time, though cellular immunity may provide longer protection. This is an area of ongoing research and legitimate debate.

### International Perspective: Other Developed Countries Do Not Universally Vaccinate at Birth

The ACIP committee explicitly noted that **"the United States' universal recommendation of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was an outlier among developed countries with low hepatitis B prevalence."**

Examples:
- **Japan:** Universal hepatitis B vaccination begins at 2 months (except for babies of HBV-positive mothers, who receive the birth dose)
- **Sweden:** Universal vaccination begins at 3 months (except for babies of HBV-positive mothers, who receive the birth dose)
- **United Kingdom:** Universal vaccination begins at 8 weeks
- **Many European countries:** Begin the series at 6 weeks to 3 months

These countries achieve excellent hepatitis B protection without universal birth dosing. They use risk-based birth dosing (for babies of infected mothers) and universal vaccination starting at 2-3 months.

### Delaying to the 2-Month Visit

Important clarification: delaying the birth dose is not the same as skipping the vaccine. The vaccine series can still be completed with the same three-dose schedule, just starting at 2 months instead of birth.

Many developed countries use schedules that begin at 6 weeks to 3 months of age and achieve excellent protection rates. If you defer the birth dose, your baby can begin the series at 2 months with full immunity still achievable.

## Transmission: How Would Baby Get It?

Understanding exactly how hepatitis B spreads to newborns helps clarify the decision.

### Mother-to-Child (The Primary Concern)

This is why the birth dose exists. Without intervention:
- Babies born to mothers with high viral loads have a 70-90% chance of infection
- Babies born to mothers with lower viral loads have a 5-20% chance of infection

With the vaccine and HBIG at birth, effectiveness is 94% even for exposed infants.

**Critical point:** If the mother tests negative for hepatitis B, mother-to-child transmission cannot occur. The virus is not there to transmit.

### Other Routes

**Household transmission:** If a household member is infected (even unknowingly), transmission is possible through blood contact from minor cuts, sores, or shared personal items. This risk is real but relatively small in developed countries with low hepatitis B rates.

**Other routes** (sexual transmission, needlestick injuries) are not relevant for typical newborn circumstances.

## Safety Profile

### What Research Shows

The hepatitis B vaccine has been given to millions of newborns over 30+ years. Here is what extensive surveillance shows:

- No link to serious adverse outcomes including neonatal death, seizures, or neurological disorders
- No association with autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis (despite concerns raised in 1998)
- A comprehensive review of at least 12 million doses found no serious health problems linked to the vaccine
- Even in vulnerable preterm infants, the safety record is excellent

### Common Reactions

Most infants have no side effects or only mild, temporary reactions:
- **Injection site soreness or redness:** 8-20% of newborns (rarely severe)
- **Fever:** 0-6% of newborns (rarely severe)
- **Mild fussiness:** Typically resolves in 1-2 days

### Serious Adverse Events (Extremely Rare)

Severe reactions can occur but are extraordinarily uncommon:
- **Anaphylaxis** (severe allergic reaction): Approximately 1 per 600,000 doses
- When anaphylaxis occurs, it happens quickly, medical staff are present, and it responds well to treatment
- Death from vaccine-related anaphylaxis is extraordinarily rare

The hepatitis B vaccine is one of the safest vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule.

## Making Your Decision

### Questions to Consider

**About your hepatitis B status:**
- Do you know your screening results? When were you tested?
- Are you confident in the accuracy of your results?

**About household risk:**
- Do any household members have known hepatitis B infection?
- Has everyone in your household been tested?
- Are household members vaccinated?

**About follow-up care:**
- Do you have reliable access to pediatric care at 2 months?
- Can you commit to completing the three-dose series if you delay?

### Factors That Favor the Birth Dose

Proceed with the birth dose if:
- You have not been tested for hepatitis B or your status is unknown
- You test positive for hepatitis B
- A household member has hepatitis B or unknown status
- You use injection drugs or have household members who do
- You will travel to areas with higher hepatitis B rates
- You are uncomfortable with any delay in protection

### Factors That May Support Delaying

Deferral may be reasonable if:
- You have been reliably tested and confirmed negative during this pregnancy
- All household members are tested negative or vaccinated
- Your healthcare provider supports deferral
- You have reliable access to follow-up care at 2 months
- You can commit to completing the full series

### How to Decline the Birth Dose If Desired

If you decide to defer, here is how to communicate your decision:

**Sample language for your birth plan:**

> "We decline the Hepatitis B vaccine at this time. I am Hepatitis B negative. We will begin the vaccine series at the 2-month well-baby visit."

**Steps to take:**

1. **Confirm** your hepatitis B test results with your provider before delivery
2. **Verify** household members' status (tested negative or vaccinated)
3. **Document** your decision in writing in your birth plan
4. **Communicate** your decision to hospital staff when you arrive
5. **Schedule** the first dose at the 2-month visit before leaving the hospital
6. **Commit** to completing the full three-dose series

**Know your rights:** This is a legal decision you can make as a parent. The 2025 ACIP guidelines explicitly support individual-based decision-making for hepatitis B-negative mothers. You do not need to provide extensive justification, though having your negative test results documented helps.

**Important:** Deferring the birth dose is not the same as declining the vaccine entirely. The goal is to complete the full series by 6-8 months of age.

### If You Choose the Birth Dose

Your newborn will receive a single injection in the thigh within the first 24 hours of life. Common mild side effects include soreness at the injection site or mild fever. Two additional doses will be scheduled at 1-2 months and 6-18 months.

## Our Take

The 2025 policy change gives you a choice that did not exist before—and for hepatitis B-negative mothers, it is a choice grounded in science.

**The natural advocate perspective:**

If you are hepatitis B negative, your baby has **zero risk** of hepatitis B infection at birth. Zero. Hepatitis B spreads through blood and sexual contact—routes that are not relevant for newborns in typical family situations.

The birth dose was adopted in 1991 partly because hospitals provide a "captive audience" where vaccination can be guaranteed—not because there is medical urgency for day-one protection in low-risk babies. The United States was an outlier: most developed countries with low hepatitis B rates (Japan, Sweden, UK, and others) do not universally vaccinate at birth.

Additionally, there are legitimate questions about whether immunity from birth vaccination lasts through adolescence and adulthood, when actual hepatitis B risk begins. If antibody levels wane by the teen years, the timing of vaccination matters.

**For hepatitis B-negative mothers with no household risk factors, delaying the vaccine to 2 months—or even to school age—is a completely reasonable decision.** You are not refusing protection. You are choosing when to provide it.

**The mainstream perspective:**

The hepatitis B vaccine has prevented countless cases of chronic liver disease and cancer in children. Its safety record after 30 years is excellent. The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to recommend it for all newborns, citing concerns that delayed schedules may lead to missed doses and that household transmission risks (even if low) are real.

The AAP argues that universal birth dosing ensures no baby falls through the cracks, protects against unknown household exposures, and has proven effective for three decades.

**What matters most:**

If you defer the birth dose, you are not opting out of the vaccine—you are choosing to start the series at a different time. The commitment to complete all three doses remains essential. A baby who gets the first dose at 2 months and completes the series is protected. A baby who skips the birth dose and never gets the series is not.

**If you are unsure,** the birth dose remains the safest choice. It has worked for 30 years, it has an excellent safety record, and it provides protection from day one.

**If you choose to defer,** understand that you are making an informed decision supported by the 2025 CDC guidelines. Work closely with your healthcare provider, schedule your follow-up appointments before leaving the hospital, and follow through with the full series.
