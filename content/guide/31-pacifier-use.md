# Pacifier Use

## THE QUICK ANSWER

Pacifiers are safe—and may even reduce SIDS risk—once breastfeeding is established (usually 3-4 weeks). The "nipple confusion" concern is largely overstated. If you want to use one, wait until nursing is going well, then introduce without guilt.

## WHAT IT IS

Pacifiers satisfy a baby's natural urge to suck for comfort rather than nutrition. The debate centers on timing: Will early pacifier use interfere with breastfeeding? What do hospitals allow?

## THE EVIDENCE

**The nipple confusion debate:**
- Theory: Pacifiers teach different sucking mechanics that make breastfeeding harder
- Reality: A Cochrane review found pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants did not significantly affect breastfeeding duration when introduced after nursing was established
- The association between pacifiers and shorter breastfeeding may be correlation, not causation—mothers struggling with nursing may turn to pacifiers more often

**SIDS risk reduction:**
- Multiple studies show pacifier use during sleep reduces SIDS risk by 50-90%
- The AAP recommends offering a pacifier at naptime and bedtime once breastfeeding is established
- This is one of the strongest arguments for pacifiers

**Other considerations:**
- Extended use (beyond age 2-3) is associated with dental problems
- May slightly increase ear infection risk
- Provides genuine comfort and helps babies self-soothe

**Hospital policies:**
- Baby-Friendly hospitals often restrict pacifiers
- These policies are based on older research and are increasingly questioned
- You can request one regardless of hospital certification

## OUR TAKE

Wait until breastfeeding is going well (3-4 weeks), then feel free to offer a pacifier. The SIDS protection alone makes them worth considering for sleep.

**Not breastfeeding?** No reason to wait. Use one from day one if you want.

**At the hospital:** You can request a pacifier even at Baby-Friendly facilities. It's your choice.

**If baby refuses:** Many do. Don't force it.

Plan to wean by age 2-3 to avoid dental issues, but that's future you's problem.

Pacifiers are a tool, not a failure.
