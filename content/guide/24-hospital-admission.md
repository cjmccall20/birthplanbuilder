# Hospital Admission: What to Expect and What You Can Control

Arriving at the hospital in labor can feel overwhelming. You're managing contractions, feeling excited and nervous, and suddenly you're faced with paperwork, questions, and medical procedures. Knowing what to expect—and what choices you have—can help you feel more in control during this transition.

This guide walks you through the typical admission process, explains your options, and helps you set a positive tone for your birth experience from the very first moment.

## THE TRIAGE PROCESS

### What Happens When You Arrive

When you walk into Labor and Delivery (or get dropped off at the entrance while your partner parks), your first stop is usually triage. Think of triage as the "assessment area" where staff determines whether you're in active labor and need to be admitted.

Here's what typically happens:

**Check-in at the desk.** You'll give your name and let them know you think you're in labor. If you pre-registered (highly recommended!), this goes much faster.

**Move to a triage room.** This is usually a smaller room with a bed, monitoring equipment, and a curtain for privacy. You may share the triage area with other people also being evaluated.

**Put on a hospital gown.** A nurse will ask you to change and get into bed so they can assess you.

**Get connected to monitors.** They'll place two elastic belts around your belly—one monitors your baby's heart rate, the other tracks your contractions.

**Answer questions.** The nurse will ask about your contractions (when they started, how far apart, how intense), whether your water broke, your medical history, and your pregnancy details.

### Being Checked for Labor Progress

The main question triage needs to answer: Are you in active labor?

To figure this out, a nurse or provider will likely:

- **Do a cervical check** to see how dilated (open) and effaced (thinned) your cervix is
- **Monitor contractions** to see their pattern and strength
- **Check baby's heart rate** to make sure baby is tolerating labor well
- **Review your history** including any complications or risk factors

This evaluation usually takes 20-60 minutes. If your labor status is unclear, they might have you walk the halls for an hour and then recheck you to see if you've progressed.

### When You Might Be Sent Home

Don't be surprised or embarrassed if this happens—it's incredibly common! You might be sent home if:

- You're less than 4-6 centimeters dilated (depending on the hospital)
- Your contractions are irregular or not strong enough
- You haven't shown change over the observation period
- Your water hasn't broken

Being sent home doesn't mean you did anything wrong. It's often called "false labor" or "prodromal labor," but there's nothing false about it—your body is just warming up. Going home to labor longer in your own comfortable space is often better than being admitted too early.

**When they'll definitely keep you:**
- Your water has broken (even without contractions)
- You're in active labor (usually 5-6+ cm dilated with regular contractions)
- There are concerns about you or baby that need monitoring
- You're having a medical emergency

## STANDARD PROCEDURES

Once you're officially admitted, you'll move to a labor room. Here's what typically happens in the first hour or so:

### Paperwork

Even if you pre-registered, there's usually more paperwork at admission. This includes:

- **Consent forms** for treatment, procedures, and potential emergencies
- **Reviewing your birth preferences** with the admitting nurse
- **Insurance and identification verification**
- **Signing HIPAA privacy forms**
- **Contact information** for your emergency contact

**Pro tip:** Pre-register around 36 weeks! Most hospitals let you complete forms ahead of time, either online or in person. This dramatically reduces the paperwork you'll deal with while having contractions.

### IV Placement or Hep Lock

Most hospitals want IV access established when you're admitted. This might be:

**A full IV line:** A needle placed in your hand or arm, connected to tubing and a bag of fluids that continuously drip into your body.

**A hep lock (saline lock):** The same needle placement, but capped off instead of connected to fluids. It gives them quick access if needed but doesn't tether you to an IV pole.

Why do they want this?
- Quick access for medications if needed
- Ability to give fluids if you become dehydrated
- Emergency access if complications arise
- Required if you want an epidural

### Fetal Monitoring Strip

You'll have the same monitoring belts from triage placed again. The initial strip usually lasts 20-30 minutes and establishes a "baseline" for how your baby is doing.

**Continuous monitoring** means wearing the belts throughout labor. Many hospitals default to this.

**Intermittent monitoring** means checking baby's heart rate periodically (often every 15-30 minutes in active labor) rather than constantly.

### Cervical Check

The admitting nurse or provider will typically do a cervical exam to establish where you are in labor. They're checking:

- **Dilation:** How open your cervix is (measured 0-10 centimeters)
- **Effacement:** How thin your cervix has become (measured as a percentage)
- **Station:** How far baby has descended into your pelvis (-3 to +3)
- **Position:** Which way baby is facing

### Vital Signs

Your blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and oxygen levels will be checked. These are typically repeated every 1-4 hours throughout labor depending on your situation.

## WHAT YOU CAN DECLINE OR DELAY

Here's something important to understand: You have the right to informed consent for every procedure. This means nothing should happen to your body without your permission, and you can ask questions, request alternatives, or decline interventions.

That said, declining everything isn't the goal. The goal is making informed choices that align with your values while keeping you and baby safe. Here are some common areas where you have options:

### Routine IV vs. Hep Lock

**What you can ask for:** A hep lock instead of continuous IV fluids. This gives you more freedom to move and isn't attached to a pole.

**Good to know:** If you become dehydrated, need medication, or want an epidural, you'll need fluids. A hep lock makes that quick to set up.

**When this might not be an option:** If you have certain medical conditions, are being induced, or your provider has specific concerns.

### Continuous vs. Intermittent Monitoring

**What you can ask for:** Intermittent monitoring, where the nurse checks baby's heart rate periodically rather than keeping you attached to monitors continuously.

**Good to know:** Intermittent monitoring lets you move more freely, use the shower or tub, and change positions easily. Research shows it's safe for low-risk labors.

**When this might not be an option:** If you have risk factors, are being induced, have an epidural, or if baby showed any concerning patterns on the initial strip.

### Limiting Cervical Checks

**What you can ask for:** Fewer cervical checks. You can decline or delay these exams, especially if your water has broken (each check slightly increases infection risk once membranes have ruptured).

**Good to know:** Dilation isn't the only sign of progress. Many people find frequent checks discouraging when numbers don't change quickly.

**When they're more important:** If your provider needs information to make decisions about your care, or if you want to know where you are.

### Knowing Your Rights

You always have the right to:

- **Ask questions:** "What are the benefits? What are the risks? What are my alternatives? What happens if I wait?"
- **Request time:** "Can I have a few minutes to think about this?"
- **Decline:** "I understand the recommendation, but I'd like to decline for now."
- **Get a second opinion:** For non-emergency situations

**Important:** Exercising your rights should involve conversation, not conflict. A good approach is: "I'd like to understand more about why you're recommending this." Most providers will explain their reasoning, and you can make a decision together.

## SETTING THE TONE

The first hour at the hospital sets the emotional tone for your entire birth experience. Here's how to start strong:

### Sharing Your Birth Preferences

Bring copies of your birth plan (if you have one) and give one to your admitting nurse. But don't just hand it over—talk about it.

**What to say:** "I put together some preferences for labor. Can we go over the highlights together? I'd love to know what's realistic here."

This opens a conversation and shows you're flexible but informed. Most nurses appreciate knowing what matters to you.

**Focus on your priorities.** Don't get hung up on every detail. What are the 3-5 things that matter most? Make sure those are clearly communicated.

### Establishing Relationship with Your Nurse

Your labor nurse is your biggest ally. In most hospitals, your nurse is with you far more than your doctor or midwife, who often arrives mainly for the pushing stage.

**Ways to build rapport:**
- Learn their name and use it
- Ask how long they've been doing this (shows interest)
- Thank them genuinely when they help you
- Be direct about what helps you cope ("I do better with quiet encouragement" or "Please tell me what's happening")
- Ask their opinion when appropriate ("What have you seen work in situations like this?")

**If it's not working:** If you and your nurse aren't clicking, your partner can quietly ask the charge nurse about switching. This happens and isn't personal—sometimes personalities just don't mesh.

### Partner as Advocate

The support person's role during admission is crucial. While you're managing contractions and medical procedures, your partner can:

- **Handle logistics:** Parking, bags, paperwork, calling family
- **Take notes:** Write down names, what people say, and any numbers given
- **Ask questions:** You might be too focused to remember your questions
- **Communicate preferences:** "She was really hoping to avoid continuous monitoring if possible—is that an option?"
- **Run interference:** Politely redirect visitors or ask for space when needed

**The golden rule for partners:** Don't fight battles you don't need to fight, but don't give up things that matter just to avoid discomfort. Find the middle ground of firm but friendly.

### "Starting As You Mean to Go On"

There's wisdom in this old phrase. If you want:

- **A calm, quiet environment:** Keep lights dim and voices low from the start
- **To move freely:** Get up and walk or use the birth ball right away rather than settling into bed
- **Limited interventions:** Make your preferences known before they become assumptions
- **Active participation in decisions:** Start asking questions during admission

Your early actions signal to staff what kind of experience you're looking for. It's easier to maintain a tone you've established than to change course later.

## DIFFERENT ADMISSION SCENARIOS

Not all admissions happen the same way. Here's what to expect in different situations:

### Emergency Admission

If you arrive with significant bleeding, very high blood pressure, severe pain, decreased fetal movement, or other emergencies, the process looks different:

- Triage moves fast—assessment happens in minutes
- Multiple staff may be involved simultaneously
- Interventions happen quickly, sometimes with explanations coming after
- You'll be monitored closely and may go directly to a labor room or OR
- Your support person might be asked to wait briefly while initial assessment happens

**What helps:** Try to stay calm and trust the process. Staff are trained for emergencies. Once things stabilize, you can ask for explanations about what happened and what comes next.

### Scheduled Induction Arrival

If you're being induced, admission feels more organized:

- You'll have a scheduled arrival time (often early morning)
- Go directly to the labor floor rather than triage
- Less urgency—more time for paperwork and questions
- IV placement happens early since you'll need fluids and medications
- Your provider will explain the induction plan

**What helps:** Ask how the induction will proceed step-by-step. Find out how long each phase typically takes. Get comfortable—early induction can be slow, so bring entertainment.

### Planned C-Section Arrival

Scheduled cesareans have their own process:

- Arrive 1-2 hours before scheduled surgery time
- Go to a pre-op area rather than labor room
- Change into a surgical gown
- IV placed for fluids and medications
- Meet with anesthesiology to discuss your spinal or epidural
- Surgical site may be shaved and cleaned
- Walk or wheelchair to the operating room

**What helps:** Ask when your support person can join you (usually after the spinal is placed). Confirm your preferences for the surgery—delayed cord clamping, skin-to-skin in OR, etc.

## PRO TIPS

### Making Admission Go Smoothly

**Before you leave home:**
- Confirm you're really in labor (call the hospital line if unsure)
- Have bags packed and by the door
- Eat a light snack if you can (you may not eat again for a while)
- Put on comfortable clothes easy to change out of
- Bring your ID and insurance card somewhere accessible

**Pre-registration makes everything easier.** Seriously. Do it around 36 weeks.

**Bring multiple copies of your birth plan.** Nurses change shifts, and you may see different providers.

**Arrive during the right stage of labor.** If possible, wait until contractions are 4-5 minutes apart, lasting about a minute, for at least an hour (the 4-1-1 rule). Coming too early often means being sent home.

**Bring your own pillow.** It's more comfortable, smells like home, and instantly makes the room feel more yours. Put it in a colorful pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed up with hospital linens.

**Know the parking situation.** Where is the drop-off? Where does your partner park? Is there a cost? Figure this out ahead of time.

**Have phone chargers ready.** Labor can be long. Dead phones are the last thing you need.

**Wear your own labor gown if you want.** Hospital gowns are free and functional, but many people prefer their own birthing gowns. Just know it might get messy.

### The Words That Open Doors

When you want something:
- "Is it possible to...?"
- "I'd prefer to try..."
- "Can we talk about alternatives?"
- "What would you recommend?"

When you need time:
- "Can I have a few minutes to think about this?"
- "My partner and I need to discuss this privately."
- "Is this urgent or can we revisit it in an hour?"

When declining:
- "I understand, and I'd like to decline for now."
- "I'd prefer to wait on that. Can we reassess later?"
- "Thank you for the recommendation. I've decided to..."

### Things Nurses Wish Patients Knew

- **They want you to have a good experience too.** Most nurses went into this field because they love helping families through birth.
- **Clear communication helps everyone.** Tell them what you need instead of hoping they guess.
- **Shift change happens.** Don't take it personally when your nurse leaves. Get to know the new one.
- **They've seen it all.** Nothing you do will shock or embarrass them.
- **Flexibility goes both ways.** When you're flexible with them, they're often more flexible with you.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

The hospital admission process can feel like a lot, but remember:

1. **Triage is just an assessment.** Being sent home isn't failure—it might be the best thing for your labor.

2. **You have choices.** Standard procedures are recommendations, not requirements. Ask questions and understand your options.

3. **Set the tone you want.** The first hour establishes expectations. Be calm, clear, and kind.

4. **Build your team.** Your nurse is your ally. Invest in that relationship.

5. **Different admissions require different approaches.** Know what to expect whether you're in spontaneous labor, being induced, or having a planned cesarean.

6. **Preparation pays off.** Pre-register, pack smart, and know the logistics ahead of time.

You're about to meet your baby. The admission process is just the doorway to that incredible moment. Walk through it feeling informed, empowered, and ready.
