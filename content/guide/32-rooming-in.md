# Rooming In

## THE QUICK ANSWER

Rooming in (keeping baby in your room 24/7) has real benefits for bonding and breastfeeding. But it can be exhausting when you're recovering from birth. If a nursery is available and you need rest, using it doesn't make you a bad parent.

## WHAT IT IS

Rooming in means your newborn stays with you around the clock rather than spending time in the hospital nursery. Most hospitals now default to this. Many Baby-Friendly hospitals have eliminated nurseries entirely.

## THE EVIDENCE

**Benefits of rooming in:**
- Better breastfeeding: Feeding on demand is easier when baby is right there
- Bonding: Constant proximity triggers bonding hormones
- Learning baby's cues: You observe patterns before going home
- Some research suggests it may reduce hospital errors

**The exhaustion reality:**
- You just gave birth—your body needs recovery
- Newborns feed every 2-3 hours, leaving little sustained sleep
- Hospital rooms have constant interruptions: vitals, meals, staff
- Sleep deprivation is linked to postpartum mood disorders
- Partners often can't stay comfortably, leaving you alone overnight

**What research shows:** While rooming in supports breastfeeding, studies don't account well for maternal exhaustion and mental health. A few hours of nursery care so you can sleep has not been shown to harm outcomes.

## OUR TAKE

Rooming in is wonderful in theory—but not a moral imperative. Your baby needs you healthy, not depleted.

**If you have nursery access:** Use it when you need it. A 3-4 hour sleep stretch is transformative. Ask them to bring baby for feedings.

**If there's no nursery:** Ask if nurses can watch baby at the station. Have your partner take shifts.

**What actually matters:** Skin-to-skin when awake. Responsive feeding. Rest when you can. These aren't mutually exclusive with occasional nursery time.

There is no shame in needing rest. A rested parent is a safer, more present parent.
