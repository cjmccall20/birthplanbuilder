# Directed vs Spontaneous Pushing

## THE QUICK ANSWER

Spontaneous pushing (following your body's urges) is generally better than directed "purple pushing" (coached, breath-holding pushes). However, with an epidural, some direction may help since you can't feel the urges as well.

## WHAT IT IS

**Directed pushing (Valsalva/purple pushing):**
- Staff tells you when and how to push
- "Take a deep breath, hold it, push for 10 seconds, repeat!"
- Standard in most US hospitals
- Called "purple pushing" because mothers' faces often turn purple from breath-holding

**Spontaneous pushing:**
- You push when you feel the urge
- Follow your body's natural rhythm
- May involve grunting, shorter pushes, breathing between efforts
- More common in birth centers and home births

## THE EVIDENCE

**Why directed pushing became standard:**
- Continuous fetal monitoring created pressure to speed up pushing
- The assumption was that faster = better
- Staff could "coach" even when the mother had no urge to push

**What research shows about spontaneous pushing:**
- No difference in time to delivery in most studies
- Less fatigue for the mother
- Lower rates of pelvic floor damage
- Better fetal oxygenation (baby gets more oxygen between pushes)
- Lower rates of abnormal fetal heart patterns

**Problems with directed pushing:**
- Breath-holding reduces oxygen to baby
- Sustained pressure damages pelvic floor muscles
- More exhausting for mother
- Can cause hemorrhoids and vaginal tearing
- Ignores the body's natural reflex

**The epidural factor:**
- Epidurals can block the urge to push
- Some direction may be necessary to know when contractions happen
- "Laboring down" (waiting for baby to descend before pushing) reduces need for intense directed pushing

**What the research recommends:**
- ACOG acknowledges both approaches are acceptable
- Many midwifery organizations prefer spontaneous pushing
- Upright positions often make spontaneous pushing more intuitive

## OUR TAKE

If you don't have an epidural, push when and how your body tells you. Don't let someone count to 10 while you hold your breath until you're purple. Short pushes with breathing between them are fine.

**How to request it:** "I'd like to push spontaneously, following my body's cues. Please don't coach me unless I ask for help."

**With an epidural:** You may need some guidance since you can't feel the urges. Ask for gentle direction: "Let me know when I'm having a contraction" rather than aggressive counting.

**Laboring down:** If you have an epidural, ask about waiting to push until you feel pressure or baby is visible. This reduces the time you need to actively push.

Your body knows how to do this. Trust it.
