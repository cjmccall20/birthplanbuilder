# Hospital Bag Checklist: What You Actually Need

Pack your hospital bag between 35-37 weeks. Not because you'll need it that early, but because labor doesn't check your calendar. A bag sitting by the door means one less thing to think about when contractions start.

Here's the thing about hospital bag lists: most include 40+ items when you really need about 15. You're going for one to three nights, not a week-long vacation. The hospital provides more than you'd expect. Over-packing just means more stuff to haul home while recovering with a newborn.

## THE ESSENTIALS (Don't Leave Without These)

These items genuinely matter. Everything else is optional.

- **Insurance card and ID** - You'll register upon arrival
- **Phone and charger** (get a 10-foot cord - hospital outlets are always behind the bed)
- **Birth plan copies** - Two or three printed copies for nurses and doctors
- **Going-home outfit for you** - Something loose that fit when you were 5-6 months pregnant
- **Going-home outfit for baby** - Weather-appropriate, 0-3 month size
- **Car seat** - Properly installed before labor begins. Staff will check before discharge
- **Comfortable robe or cardigan** - Hospital gowns open in the back
- **Slip-on shoes or slippers** - You'll be walking the halls
- **Hair ties** - Simple but essential during labor
- **Toiletries** - Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, face wash (hospital basics are very basic)
- **Glasses or contacts** - If you need them
- **Nursing bra** - If you're planning to breastfeed
- **Disposable underwear** - Depends or similar (more on this below)
- **Snacks** - A few granola bars, crackers, dried fruit

## FOR LABOR

Labor can last hours or days. Pack items that help you cope with contractions and pass the time during early labor.

### Comfort Items
- **Your own pillow** - Hospital pillows are thin and plastic-covered. Bring one from home in a bright, non-white pillowcase so it doesn't get left behind
- **Fuzzy socks or gripper socks** - Hospital floors are cold and slippery
- **Lightweight robe** - Easier than hospital gowns when walking, especially if you want to cover up
- **Lip balm** - Breathing techniques dry out your mouth
- **Hair ties and headbands** - Keep hair off your face

### Natural Pain Management
- **Massage oil or lotion** - For back rubs during contractions
- **Tennis balls** - For counter-pressure on your lower back
- **Heat pack** (microwavable rice sock) - Hospital may have these, but bring your own to be safe
- **Comb** - Squeezing a comb in your palm during contractions activates acupressure points

### Food and Drinks
Check your hospital's policy first - some restrict eating during labor.

- **Clear liquids** - Coconut water, sports drinks, broth packets
- **Sugar-free hard candy** - Keeps your mouth moist without making you thirstier
- **Light snacks** - Crackers, applesauce pouches, honey sticks for energy
- **Water bottle with a straw** - Easier to drink while lying down

### Entertainment for Early Labor
Early labor can take 12+ hours. You might be bored before you're uncomfortable.

- **Phone loaded with shows or podcasts** - Download offline, hospital WiFi is unreliable
- **Book or magazine** - Screen-free option
- **Headphones** - For your own entertainment and for focus during active labor

### The Big One
- **Extra-long phone charger** - 10 feet minimum. Outlets in hospital rooms are always in the worst spots. You'll want your phone for timing contractions, music, and yes, those first photos.

## FOR AFTER BIRTH

Recovery is messier than pregnancy books prepare you for. Pack accordingly.

### Clothing
- **Going-home outfit** - Loose dress or stretchy pants with an empire waist. Skip anything with a tight waistband. Your belly will still look 5-6 months pregnant.
- **Nursing bras or tanks** - Soft, no underwire. Your breasts will be tender and changing size.
- **Comfy pajamas or nightgown** - Optional. Hospital gowns work fine, but some people feel more human in their own clothes.
- **Cardigan or zip-up hoodie** - Easy to nurse in and hospital rooms run cool

### The Underwear Situation
The hospital provides mesh underwear and giant pads. They work. But many experienced moms swear by bringing their own Depends-style disposable underwear instead. Here's why:

**Depends (or similar) are better because:**
- Everything stays in place - no shifting pads
- You don't have to worry about leaks onto hospital bedding
- Easier to pull up and down when you're sore
- Feel more like actual underwear than mesh
- No bulky pad situation

Bring a pack in your hospital bag and a pack at home. You'll use them for 1-2 weeks postpartum.

### Toiletries
Hospital toiletries are functional but not pleasant. Bring:
- **Your own shampoo and conditioner** - Travel sizes work
- **Face wash and moisturizer**
- **Deodorant**
- **Toothbrush and toothpaste**
- **Makeup** - Only if it makes you feel better. Most people skip it.

## FOR BABY

This list is short because the hospital provides almost everything. Don't overpack baby items.

### What You Actually Need to Bring
- **Going-home outfit** - Weather-appropriate. In winter, choose something that works with a car seat harness (avoid puffy snowsuits). In summer, a lightweight cotton outfit with a hat for sun protection.
- **Receiving blanket** - For the car seat in cold weather. Never put baby in a puffy coat in the car seat.
- **Car seat** - Installed correctly in your vehicle BEFORE labor. This is non-negotiable. The hospital won't discharge you without a safe car seat. Get it checked at a local fire station or certified inspection site if you're not confident in the installation.

### What You Don't Need to Bring
- Multiple outfits (baby will wear hospital blankets and a onesie)
- Diapers (hospital provides them)
- Wipes (hospital provides them)
- Pacifier (wait until breastfeeding is established, usually 3-4 weeks)
- Hats (hospital provides them)
- Socks and mittens (baby will be swaddled)

**One outfit. One blanket. Car seat. That's it.**

## FOR YOUR PARTNER OR SUPPORT PERSON

Labor can last 24+ hours. Your support person needs supplies too.

### Essentials
- **Change of clothes** - At least one full outfit, possibly two
- **Toiletries** - Toothbrush, deodorant, etc.
- **Phone charger** - Their own, don't share
- **Comfortable shoes** - They'll be on their feet providing support

### Food Situation
Your partner can eat when you can't (if you're restricted). They should:
- **Pack substantial snacks** - Nuts, protein bars, dried fruit, crackers
- **Bring cash or card** - For cafeteria and vending machines
- **Know the hospital food options** - Cafeteria hours, nearby restaurants, delivery options

### Entertainment
- **Book, tablet, or downloaded shows** - For early labor downtime
- **Laptop** - If they need to work remotely (labor takes a while sometimes)

### Support Items
- **Bathing suit** - If you're using a labor tub, your partner may want to get in with you
- **Camera** - If you want photos beyond phone quality
- **Watch with a second hand** - For timing contractions if phone dies

## NATURAL BIRTH ADD-ONS

Planning an unmedicated birth? These items help create a calm environment and provide natural pain relief.

### Atmosphere
- **Battery-powered LED candles** - Real flames aren't allowed. Warm white gives a calming glow.
- **Fairy lights** - Battery-powered string lights can transform a clinical room
- **Bluetooth speaker** - For hypnobirthing tracks, meditation, or calming music
- **Eye mask** - For resting between contractions and blocking harsh hospital lighting
- **Focal point object** - Something to focus on during contractions. A photo, a small statue, anything meaningful.

### Scent
- **Essential oils** - Check hospital policy first. If allowed:
  - Lavender for relaxation
  - Peppermint for nausea
  - Clary sage to support contractions (use only during active labor)
  - Frankincense for grounding
- **Diffuser** - Portable battery-powered diffuser
- **Tissues or cotton balls** - For placing essential oil drops if diffuser isn't allowed

### Pain Management
- **TENS unit** - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The BabycareTENS brand has a specific "boost" mode for contractions. Place electrodes on lower back during early labor. Many people find significant relief from this.
- **Massage tools** - Roller balls, wooden massage tools, anything that helps your partner apply counter-pressure without tiring out their hands
- **Birth ball** - Hospital usually provides these, but confirm
- **Rice sock** - Tube sock filled with rice, microwave to warm. Amazing for back labor.
- **Peanut ball** - Helps open pelvis if laboring on your side

### Mental Focus
- **Birth affirmation cards** - Printed or on your phone
- **Hypnobirthing audio** - Downloaded to your phone (don't rely on streaming)
- **Headphones** - To listen without distraction
- **Printed birth preferences** - Multiple copies

## PRO TIPS

**Pack early.** 35-37 weeks. Babies arrive on their own schedule.

**Use separate bags.** One small bag for labor (things you'll want access to immediately), one bag for postpartum and baby stuff, partner has their own bag. Label them.

**Leave valuables home.** No expensive jewelry, no large amounts of cash. Hospital rooms have limited security.

**Wear your going-home outfit to the hospital.** It'll be loose and comfortable - perfect for laboring in at home before you head in. Then you have a real outfit to go home in and don't need to bring one.

**Preload your phone.** Download music, hypnobirthing tracks, shows, podcasts before you go. Hospital WiFi is notoriously unreliable.

**Bring an empty bag.** You'll accumulate hospital supplies, paperwork, and gifts. Having a collapsible bag to bring everything home is helpful.

**Know your hospital's specific policies.** Call ahead and ask:
- Can you eat during labor?
- Are essential oils/diffusers allowed?
- Do they provide birthing balls?
- What's the visitor policy?

**Pack snacks for after delivery.** Hospital kitchen may be closed when you deliver. Having crackers, nuts, or granola bars means you can eat when you're starving at 3am.

**Bring your own pillow.** Use a distinctive pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed up with hospital linens.
