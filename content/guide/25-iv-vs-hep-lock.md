# IV vs Hep Lock

## THE QUICK ANSWER

A hep lock (saline lock) gives you IV access without being tethered to a pole. You can walk, move, use the shower, and labor more freely. Most low-risk women don't need continuous IV fluids—request a hep lock instead.

## WHAT IT IS

**IV (Intravenous) line:** A catheter in your vein connected to a bag of fluids on a pole. You're attached to the pole and must wheel it with you everywhere.

**Hep lock (saline lock):** The same catheter in your vein, but capped off instead of connected to fluids. It's flushed periodically to keep it open. You're free to move without dragging equipment.

Both provide quick access if you need medications or fluids later. The difference is whether you're connected to a drip right now.

## THE EVIDENCE

**Why hospitals want IV access:**
- Quick route for medications if needed (Pitocin, antibiotics, pain meds)
- Fluid administration if you become dehydrated
- Emergency access if complications arise
- Required for epidural placement

**Why continuous fluids aren't always necessary:**
- Healthy women can drink fluids during labor (see Eating/Drinking section)
- Over-hydration can cause problems: swelling, diluted blood sodium, difficulty with breastfeeding due to breast engorgement
- One study found women receiving IV fluids had babies who lost more weight initially, possibly due to maternal fluid retention inflating birth weight
- Continuous fluids increase bathroom trips, which can be disruptive during labor

**The mobility issue:** Freedom to move during labor is associated with shorter labors and less pain. Being tethered to an IV pole limits your options—walking, showering, using the birth ball, changing positions all become harder.

**When you actually need continuous IV:**
- GBS+ and receiving antibiotics
- Pitocin induction/augmentation
- Epidural (fluid bolus required)
- Dehydration or inability to drink
- Certain medical conditions

## OUR TAKE

Request a hep lock unless you have a specific medical reason for continuous fluids. Here's how to ask:

**At admission:** "I'd prefer a hep lock instead of continuous fluids. Is there a medical reason I need a drip right now?"

**If they push back:** "I understand you want IV access. I'm fine with the hep lock for access—I just don't want to be connected to fluids unless I need them."

**Know that:** If you get an epidural or Pitocin, you'll need to convert to continuous IV anyway. The hep lock just gives you freedom during the earlier stages of labor when movement matters most.

This is a small request that makes a real difference in your ability to move and labor actively. Most providers will agree if you ask.
