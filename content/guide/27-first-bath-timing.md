# First Bath Timing

## THE QUICK ANSWER

Delay your baby's first bath for at least 24 hours—ideally longer. The white coating (vernix) on your baby isn't dirt; it's beneficial protection that moisturizes skin and fights infection. There's no medical reason to wash it off immediately.

## WHAT IT IS

Vernix caseosa is the waxy, cheese-like coating on newborns. For decades, hospitals washed babies within hours of birth. New evidence shows this practice removes beneficial substances and can stress newborns. WHO now recommends waiting at least 24 hours.

## THE EVIDENCE

**What vernix does:**
- Natural moisturizer that protects delicate newborn skin
- Antimicrobial properties—contains proteins that fight bacteria and fungi
- Helps regulate baby's temperature during the transition to life outside the womb
- Acts as a barrier while baby's skin matures

**Problems with early bathing:**
- Hypothermia risk: Wet newborns lose heat rapidly. Early baths are a leading cause of temperature instability.
- Blood sugar drops: Cold stress can cause hypoglycemia
- Interrupts bonding: Separating baby for a bath during the critical first hours disrupts skin-to-skin and breastfeeding
- Removes beneficial bacteria: The birth process seeds baby's skin with protective microbes; early washing disrupts this

**Breastfeeding connection:** Studies show delayed first bath is associated with higher exclusive breastfeeding rates. The amniotic fluid smell on baby's skin may help guide them to the breast.

**What guidelines say:**
- WHO: Delay bathing for at least 24 hours
- Many hospitals now delay 8-24+ hours
- Some advocate waiting until the cord stump falls off (1-2 weeks)

## OUR TAKE

Tell the hospital you want to delay the first bath. 24 hours is the minimum—2-3 days is better. The vernix absorbs naturally.

**What to say:** "We'd like to delay the bath for at least 24 hours. Please just wipe off any blood gently."

**When you do bathe:** Plain water only. No soap on newborn skin for the first few weeks.

**Who gives the bath:** Ask if you can give the first bath. It's a bonding moment.

The messy-looking coating is exactly what your baby needs. Leave it alone.
