# When to Leave the Hospital

## THE QUICK ANSWER

Vaginal births typically stay 24-48 hours; C-sections stay 2-4 days. If you and baby are healthy, you can often leave earlier than the default. You can also stay longer if you need more recovery time or support.

## WHAT IT IS

Hospital discharge timing has shortened dramatically over decades. What used to be week-long stays are now 1-2 days for vaginal births. The question is: What's the right amount of time for YOU?

## THE EVIDENCE

**Typical stays:**
- Uncomplicated vaginal birth: 24-48 hours
- C-section: 2-4 days
- Complications: Varies based on situation

**What must happen before discharge:**
- Baby passes hearing screening
- Newborn screening (heel prick) completed
- Baby feeding adequately (milk coming in or colostrum sufficient)
- Baby urinating and stooling appropriately
- Pediatrician/provider examines baby
- Mother's bleeding is under control
- Mother can urinate on her own
- Mother has adequate pain management plan
- Car seat available

**Early discharge considerations:**
- Some healthy mothers and babies leave at 24 hours
- Requires follow-up appointment within 1-2 days
- Not recommended for first-time parents without strong support at home
- Must have pediatrician lined up for quick follow-up

**Reasons to stay longer:**
- Breastfeeding difficulties (lactation support available in hospital)
- Concerns about baby's jaundice
- Need for rest and recovery
- Limited support at home
- C-section recovery requiring more monitoring

**Insurance coverage:** The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act requires insurers to cover at least 48 hours for vaginal birth, 96 hours for C-section. You're entitled to this time if you want it.

## OUR TAKE

**Don't rush home** just because you can. The hospital has nurses, lactation consultants, and support. Use that time.

**Don't stay longer than you want** just because it's the default. If you're healthy, baby is healthy, and you have support at home, earlier discharge is fine.

**First-time parents:** Consider the full 48 hours. Breastfeeding help and newborn care guidance are valuable.

**Experienced parents:** You may be fine leaving earlier—you've done this before.

**After C-section:** Take the recovery time. Major surgery requires rest.

**Ask what you need:** "Can we have the lactation consultant visit again?" "Can we stay one more night?" Advocate for what serves your recovery.

You'll know when you're ready.
